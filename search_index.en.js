Binary to Rule Them All"},"https://joinbase.io/benchmark/":{"body":"What's JoinBase\nJoinBase is an end-to-end database database for IoT. With it, you can do top performance real-time analytics over massive IoT device's bigdata deluges at an extremely low cost in one stop.\nGet started in three minutes!\nMore information of JoinBase is around the website.\nBenchmark\nIn this article, JoinBase and interesting peers (Timescale and ClickHouse now) will be benchmarked. \nSince there is no suitable benchmark program to bench the new end-to-end database for IoT, we built an open source project for benchmarking ourselves. This is, just the \"Open IoT Database Benchmark Suite\" (OIDBS), which we have open-sourced into the community. \nBenchmark Model\nThe core of OIDBS is the benchmark model, which is used for grouping different benchmark dataset and its corresponding data-gens, schemas, queries.\nIn the first launch of JoinBase and OIDBS, two models - 'nyct_lite' and 'nyct_strip' are benched: \nmodel namemodel dataset sizedescriptionhow to get\nnyct_lite10906860 rowsNew York City Dataset used in official Timescale  (compressed in one 424MB file)Timescale Docs\nnyct_strip1000000000 rowsExtended 1-billion-row New York City Dataset with stripped columns (compressed in 13GB files)download pre-made from mediafire  or  prepare from this github project\n\n Tab.1 OIDBS models introduction \nThese two models are derived from official, real-world New York city dataset. The nyct_lite is relatively small dataset, but it is exactly what Timescale uses to demonstrate its application in the IoT field. \nThe importance of nyct_lite model is that:\n\nthe dataset, schemas, (parts of) queries in this model are all from Timescale. So, obviously, we can't lower the performance of our competitors by picking specific dataset, schemas, or queries. As an open benchmark suite, we clearly reject this practice that is indeed common in other benchmarks.\nbecause the size of nyct_lite is relatively small, it is a great real-world dataset to understand the performance situation for the edge case and the short-term IoT data analysis and monitoring scenario. \n\nThe nyct_strip could be seen as the bigdata version of nyct_lite. We extract 1 billion rows and 7 representative columns from the around 1.7 billion rows and 27-column original schema to form a stripped dataset. The size of the original is too large to reproduce (compressed 600GB+ csv). For users, it makes non sense to claim that any result on non-reproducible dataset. \nThe importance of nyct_strip model is that: the big data scenario is the standard situation for most IoT businesses.\nSetup\nItemDescription\nHardware2 AWS EC2 m6a.16xlarge instances  (1 server, 1 client) with  600MB/s EBS gp3 volume\nOSUbuntu 2022.04 LTS with  C-states and Turbo Boost disabled\nJoinBaseEnterprise 2022.04\nTimescalePostgresql 14.3 with  Timescale extension 2.6.1, Timescaledb-tune 0.12.0 (the latest from official download)\nClickHouseClickHouse 2022.5  (the latest from official download)\n\n Tab.2 Setup for the benchmark \nTimescale and ClickHouse are selected as the comparing group in this benchmark. We think these two are the representative DBMSs in TP and AP fields respectively. Indeed, many other products that claim to outperform these two. But based on our testing or knowledge, we don't think they deserve to be included in this benchmark.\nBy comparing with these two state-of-the-art DBMSs, we hope to show interesting and profound conclusions, and finally why JoinBase is the unique product to cover the full payload spectrum for IoT domain in the world. \nAWS m6a.16xlarge instance uses AMD 3rd generation EPYC CPU. We think it is relatively modern hardware. However, the vCPU counting of m6a.16xlarge is quite restrained in that the upcoming Zen4 based EPYC will have up to 256 hyper-threads. \nC-states and Turbo Boost have been disabled in the formal benchmark. The c-states switching and boosting causes obvious run time fluctuations. Furthermore, in a highly concurrent production environment, there is no possible to boost for busy cores unless your software much under-utilize the CPUs. The boosting is just one pitfall of the micro-benchmark, which could be seen in benchmarks before.\nLast, we use the latest available versions of all softwares to make sure all benched peers are in the officially best condition.\nPerformance Comparison - Write side\nThe write side benching should be one of the most interesting bench points. However, due to that there is no true IoT messaging native domain database except JoinBase. An apple-to-apple comparison can not be done, indeed. \nHere, we just give out the world record level performance data of JoinBase and some observations on other benched dbs.\nDBModelBatch SizeThreads  *  ConnectionsElapsed Time (in seconds)Million messages/s\nJoinBasenyct_lite11  * 1270.4\nnyct_strip150 * 14462.2\ninternal stress  2 columns, 12B/row164 * 32n/a8.4\ninternal stress  10 columns, ~90B/row164 * 32n/a1.8\nTimescalenyct_lite50001  *?1890.06\nnyct_lite500016 *?250.4\nnyct_lite500032 *?250.4\nnyct_strip500016 *?4652.1\nnyct_strip500032 *?4082.4\n\n Tab.3 Setup for the benchmark \nNote, \n\nFor the elapsed time in importing, we use the best value in the whole one-week bench period.\nJoinBase's importing in OIDBS only uses one file per thread/worker concurrency, this will lead to nyct_lite, nyct_strip external model has not enough client concurrency. \nJoinBase uses MQTT based one-by-one message importing. But, for Timescale, OIDBS uses external timescaledb-parallel-copy tool to import csv, it does batching in its own way. Otherwise, the import speed of Timescale will be too slow to complete the import of nyct_strip bigdata.\nDue to no convenient way to do multi-thread network based data ingestion for ClickHouse, we do not include the data of ClickHouse here. But, generally, it is quietly slow if the naive, local clickhouse-client based csv importing used in our experience.\nIn the internal stress of JoinBase, we use a fixed time period, for example 100s, so just the MPS(Messages Per Second)s are cared and shown in these rows.\nWe don't know and are not interesting in how timescaledb-parallel-copy handle the connections, so the item for Timescale importing shows as ?.\nOne interesting thing: we observe that Timescale needs too long time to drop a new ingested large table.\n\nThe most exciting thing is that, JoinBase importing uses the MQTT based one-by-one messaging. One-by-one messaging capability is a unique IoT domain demands, and should a must for any database call itself \"database for IoT\". Any client-side batching mechanism comes at the cost of increased latency and thus increased risk of unresponsiveness, which should be unacceptable for IoT users. \nIn our internal stress, 8.4 million messages/s sustained throughput in one-by-one message (a.k.a. batch size = 1) importing can be achieved in JoinBase. Although Timescale also has a good result when batching enabled in client (the timescaledb-parallel-copy tool here), the first version of JoinBase still crushes it with enough concurrency in one-by-one style. \nupdate (2022.12):\nIn the initial release, JoinBase does not support batched message ingestion. This has changed after 2022.11. With the batch ingestion support, JoinBase can reach a sustained throughput of 25 million messages per second (50 msgs/batch, 40 bytes/msg), and this is not the maximum value, as at this point our NVME SSD(WDC PC SN730)'s continuous write (out-of-buffer) bandwidth (avg ~1GB/s) has become saturated!\nPerformance Comparison - Query Latency\nThe benchmark item to query latency is used for measuring the response time to a single query. \nIn the benchmark, we run three times per query and uses the best run time among three as the final result. It is nice to pick up the best result because a system may need some warmups for queries, e.g. cache, decompressing. Pay attention that we are benching serious DBMSs for massive data not in-memory toys.\nFor 10-million-row level nyct_lite model, 8 queries has been proposed. Among of them, both the seventh and eighth queries are taken as-is from Timescale itself's document - Introduction to IoT: New York City Taxicabs. (All other queries in this document are multi-table queries a.k.a. joins. We will add these queries to the benchmark in the near future when JoinBase's high performance join implementation coming.) See more detailed SQLs in our OIDBS source.\nNoQuery description for nyct_lite model\n1get row counts of whole dataset\n2get all passengers\n3get all total amounts\n4get average passengers for every payment_type\n5get all big-trips passengers by 3 dimensions\n6get 4 aggregations by 3 dimensions\n7How many rides of each rate type took place in the month?\n8What is the daily average fare amount for rides with only one passenger for first 7 days?\n\n Tab.4 Queries in the `nyct_lite` model \nNote,\n\nDue to the time limitation, the ClickHouse bench is done by manual. The related scripts could be seen in the OIDBS project here. We continuously issue many times (&gt;= 10 times) in clickhouse-client and record the best/shortest run time. It has been observed that the fluctuation of ClickHouse's run time is very large. But because we just record the best one, it is believed that this does not affect the results.\nFor JoinBase and ClickHouse server, we just use the default configuration. As we are good at the two databases, it is believed to be best for both. For Timescale, the timescaledb-tune tool is applied according to the official document. It is interesting that, we see +92% (Q2) to -92% (Q5) speedup by applying the timescaledb-tune. Yes, it is not always a positive speedup. For the Q5 query, a strong slowdown occurs. But generally, we still observe ~20% improvement in the run time.\n\nJump to the result!\n\n\n\n\n Fig.1 Query latency benchmark results for nyct_lite \nElapsed time ratioClickHouse:JoinBaseTimescale:JoinBase\nQ12.567394430.758665\nQ27.179487447.198974\nQ36.7659620.227334\nQ41.836394170.585309\nQ53.568658161.378123\nQ62.201796212.638171\nQ73.136025102.999477\nQ82.82201270.489821\n\n Tab.5 Elapsed time ratios of ClickHouse to JoinBase and Timescale to JoinBase \nFig.1 is the query latency benchmark results for nyct_lite. We use the log scale in end-to-end query time(y axis) because the gap is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude! The specific ratios of the query time to that of JoinBase are shown in Tab.5. Additionally, two lines are put at 1 millisecond and 1 second for better quantitative understanding. Let's just summarize the exciting in results:\n\nFrom the average query latency/speed, The JoinBase is 70x to 430x (276x in average) faster than Timescale and 1.8x to 7.2x (3.76x in average) faster than ClickHouse.\nThe latency of Q1 and Q2 in JoinBase is in the microsecond level. Yes, JoinBase claims to be the first database to do the 10-million-row' sum aggregation in microseconds.\nThe max latency of JoinBase for nyct_lite,  is 28 milliseconds. In contrast, 87.5% of ClickHouse's queries are around 10 milliseconds and above, not mention that of Timescale.\nThe speedup of simple aggregations (Q1 - Q3) in JoinBase is obviously larger than that of group-by aggregations (Q4 - Q8). Because this is the first version of JoinBase, there are several important optimizations we haven't applied yet to group-by aggregations. Stay tunned!\nAgain, Q7, Q8 are the as-is queries from the Timescale's document. Welcome to reproduce them yourself.\n\n\nFor 1-billion-row level nyct_strip model, 6 queries has been proposed. Although the nyct_strip model has fewer columns than that of nyct_lite, these queries are still tweaked from nyct_lite.\nNoQuery description for nyct_strip model\n1get row counts of whole dataset\n2get total passenger counts\n3get stats of main metrics(main metrics' max, min, avg)\n4get all big-trip passengers by vendor_id and cab_type\n5group 3 metrics by 3 dimensions\n6What is the daily average total amount for all rides?\n\n Tab.6 Queries in the `nyct_strip` model \nThe benchmark process of the nyct_strip model is same to the nyct_lite, except that we use the different dataset and query set. \nGo to the results:\n\n\n\n\n Fig.2 Query latency benchmark results for nyct_strip \nElapsed Time RatioClickHouse:JoinBaseTimescale:JoinBase\nQ10.9576255274.373713\nQ210.4872931107.034925\nQ31.80226387.607608\nQ43.09163572.883191\nQ52.81585932.127069\nQ61.733894.253238\n\n Tab.7 Elapsed time ratios of ClickHouse to JoinBase and Timescale to JoinBase \nThe nyct_strip 1-billion-row dataset are more challenging, but when our IoT devices scale out, we have to face. \n\n\nFrom the average query latency/speed, The JoinBase is 32x to 5274x (1111x in average) faster than Timescale and 1x to 10.5x (3.5x in average) faster than ClickHouse.\n\n\nThe latency of 83.3% queries of JoinBase are below 500 milliseconds. JoinBase claims to be the first database to do the 1-billion-row complex aggregations in sub-second level. In contrast, 66.7% of ClickHouse's queries are around 1 second and up to 4.4 seconds, not mention that of Timescale.\n\n\nDue to the precision of ClickHouse's response time is only down to milliseconds. For the Q1 query, JoinBase's time 4.177 milliseconds, ClickHouse's is 4 milliseconds. It is thought that, on the Q1, two are in the same level.\n\n\nThere are two trends from small to big dataset:\n\n\nfor simple aggregations, the ratio becomes larger (10x to ClickHouse) and  larger (5000x to Timescale). This shows we have an excellent, strong and unique implementation for our simple aggregations.\n\n\nfor group-by aggregations, the ratio becomes smaller. This hints that there is a great improvement space for the memory sized big data set.\n\n\nThe reasons for the trend is mainly at the algorithm's implementation. We will discuss the reasons in depth in the technical blog in the appropriate future.\n\n\n\n\nPerformance Comparison - Query Concurrency\nThe benchmark item is for measuring how many the alert trigger queries to recent data can be completed per second.\nThis benchmark item is very exciting to demonstrate the uniqueness of JoinBase. When IoT devices scale, not only the incoming data goes big, various types, locations, measurements of data come in as well. In other cases, for the big enterprise or organization, kinds of queries to recent small data set will aggregated. Users always want to customize many alert trigger queries for the latest data. Note, for this case, the caching trick is useless, because the recent data is always changing in production and we want to know the newest result as possible.\nFor simplicity, we propose a specific alert like query to use the latest time period as the query interval, like this:\nDBQuery\nJoinBaseselect count(total_amount) from nyct_lite where parts 2016013112 where total_amount&lt;0\nTimescale and ClickHouseselect count(total_amount) from nyct_lite where pickup_datetime&gt;='2016-01-31 12:00:00' and pickup_datetime&lt;'2016-02-01 00:00:00' and total_amount&lt;0\n\nIn this query, an interesting extension of JoinBase to ansi-SQL is shown. It is called where parts clause, which lets users to specify explicit partitions to the query. More details about partition and where parts could be seen in the documents. Because the nyct_lite dataset (from Timescale) has a very tiny tailing data happens in 2017, we use the latest data interval in 2016, that is half of the day in 2016-01-31.\nThis query imitates an alert query to report the counting of anomaly trips in the latest half of the day, here is of those the total_amount less than zero.\nGo to the result: \n\n\n\n\n Fig.3 Query Concurrency benchmark results\nDBQPS (Queries Per Second)\nJoinBase34622.92128461751\nTimescale422.64208085668804\nClickHouse245.23233571554584\n\nAs we can see, the QPS of JoinBase is two orders of magnitude higher than that of Timescale and ClickHouse. JoinBase's custom query path is so incredibly fast that it can complete 34k lightweight adhoc aggregations for recent data in a modern mid-range box. Even TP databases (see Timescale) are far from beating, not mention the AP system (ClickHouse). \nOutlook\nSome interesting things which can not be included in the first release of JoinBase, due to the implementation or time limit.\n\n\nBenchmark updates when more performance improvement coming.\nWe just release the first version of JoinBase. There are many optimizations which we can do but not yet done currently.\n\n\nMore benchmark queries when join coming.\nThere is no doubt that JoinBase will continue to lead in the performance. Yeah, you can always trust JoinBase!\n\n\nMore robust benchmark system.\nSome databases like to exploit the weaknesses of benchmark suites, which you may meet in one paper or another clickbait blog. We want to fix this problem for our users in the new OIDBS. For example, we are considering to introduce a random seed to the benchmark queries. Query result set caching is a cheat for analytical performance benching. Before fixing this, try some random perturbation to your query expressions when evaluating.\n\n\nTPCx-IoT inspired model will come soon. \nThe model called 'pstation' is working in progress. Join the community if you are interesting to track on this.\n\n\nBenchmarks on storage data sizes.\nThe modern storage is very cheap. The storage size in a single modern box can hold PB(Peta-Byte) level data. JoinBase is built for this. In fact, for almost all enterprises, their active data will not exceed this limit. So, we think this benchmark item is not really interesting for including in any hurry. \n\n\nBenchmarks on ARM based processors.\nJoinBase supports three main stream CPU arches from day 0. With recent AWS makes Graviton3 generally available in c7g instance, it are truly interesting to show how good the JoinBase works in this processor. Still stay tunned!\n\n\nConclusion\nJoinBase is creating an unprecedented, user-oriented, end-to-end database for IoT: \n\nFor all devices, JoinBase supports the small message, out-of-order but highest concurrent write.\nFor recent data's monitoring, JoinBase supports the lowest latency, highest concurrent aggregations.\nFor medium and long-term data analysis, JoinBase supports the fastest interactive SQL queries (in all implemented features).\nFor the IoT domain, JoinBase supports MQTT message direct write, message payload mapping, device management, MQTT broker bridging, restricted resource and environment running, et.al..\n\nFinally, welcome to request the JoinBase Enterprise for free.\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/benchmark/","title":"JoinBase: Creates An Unprecedented Database for IoT era"},"https://joinbase.io/blog/":{"body":"","id":"https://joinbase.io/blog/","title":"Blog"},"https://joinbase.io/blog/clouds-quick-reivew/":{"body":"Prerequisites\nHere are a few prerequisites for this quick review:\n\nThe cloud service or demo should be free. Common users have no budget to provide a credit card to complete any review. On the other hand, only databases with excellent performance can afford permanently free tiers in cloud services or demos.\nThe database must support the SQL compatible syntax. The cost of learning a new paradigm for the common user is very high. Every paradigm has pitfall, but adhoc paradigm goes into no help when a pitfall happens.\nEasy enough. We are database experts. Hence, we propose a 15-minute rule: we stop reviewing at one database cloud service/demo If the exploration process exceeds 15 minutes after registering.\n\nExperiment\nIn this experiment, we try the follow six databases:\nDatabaseService or DemoPricingDataset SizeRegister Site or Docs\nJoinBasefull service with write + readfree tier forevernyct big + nyct literegister\nTimescalefull service with write + readfree 30-day trialnyct literegister\nClickHousedemo with read onlyn/anyct bigdocs\n?DBdemo with read onlyn/anyct bign/a\nInfluxDBdemo with read onlyn/an/aregister\nCockroachDBfull service in serverlessfree tier forevern/aregister\n\n Tab.1 Tried Database Cloud Services or Demos \nSome notes on Tab.1:\n\nOnly four cloud services or demos are reviewed in the end: JoinBase, Timescale, ClickHouse, and ?DB.\nOnly one result of ?DB is shown below. ?DB claims that it is \"the fastest open source time series database\" but the tests on its own demo server show the opposite. In fact, almost all slightly non-trivial SQL queries for its 1.6-billion-row trips time out. To avoid disputes, we do not display the name of this database. Here, the suggestion for all users is, \"Talk is cheap. Benchmark yourself.\"\nBoth InfluxDB Cloud and CockroachDB Cloud Serverless are tried. But we don't succeed in finding a way to review them within the above planned time. For InfluxDB, it has its own adhoc schema way. We have not enough time (and interest) to learn. For CockroachDB, there is no simple way to ingest a csv in my local fs to remote serverless db server.\nMore about kinds of nyct dataset could be seen in this article.\n\nDatabase ServicesSetup\nJoinBase Cloud Preview32 ~ 96 vCPUs (not guaranteed)\nTimescale Cloud32 vCPUs, 128GB RAM\nClickHouse Playground96 vCPUs (guessed)\n\n Tab.2 Setup of Reviewed Databases\nSome notes on Tab.2:\n\nThe setup of ClickHouse's playground server is not public, and so does JoinBase. Our JoinBase cloud service is powered by the multi-tenant version of JoinBase, which is also set up on a single instance now. We will adjust vCPUs  according to the number of active users. \nTimescale cloud's biggest instance for free trial is 32 vCPUs, 128GB RAM.\nAgain, this quick review just does a quantitative analysis.\n\nAccording to our 15-minute rule, only three database services or demos are reviewed.\n\n\n\n Fig.1 Reviewing Three Database Cloud Services or Demos\n\n Fig.2 ?DB shows ridiculous run times for trivial conditions\nResults\nWe divide the comparisons into two groups. Because ClickHouse Playground is read only, and 1-billion-row nyct_strip dataset is too big to import into Timescale Cloud for its slow writing performance. We can not use a single dataset for all services or demos. But smart readers can reason their own conclusions if the database query performance can be scaled with the size of the data.\n\nJoinBase Cloud Preview vs Timescale Cloud on nyct_lite dataset (the elapsed time is in the unit of milliseconds)\n\nDatabase ServiceQ1Q2Dataset Size (rows)\nJoinBase Cloud Preview0.784.4510M\nTimescale Cloud650.739840.43010M\nTimescale:JoinBase Ratio8341891:1\n\n Tab.3 JoinBase Cloud Preview vs Timescale Cloud\n\nJoinBase Cloud Preview vs ClickHouse Playground on nyct_strip dataset (the elapsed time is in the unit of second)\n\nDatabase ServiceQ1Q2Q3Q4Dataset Size (rows)\nJoinBase Cloud Preview0.1680.2590.3551.1261 billion\nClickHouse Playground1.6641.6591.7142.4313.46 billion\nClickHouse:JoinBase Ratio9.96.44.82.163.46\n\n Tab.4 JoinBase Cloud Preview vs ClickHouse Playground\nObviously, JoinBase surpasses other services in the performance of the tested queries. \nHere, the Q4 query for JoinBase and ClickHouse, in fact, is not \"apple-to-apple\". JoinBase uses String type for vendor_id, cab_type and passenger_count three columns but ClickHouse uses Enum8, which has the obvious optimization to speedup. JoinBase, indeed, has Enum like type. But here, we would like to emphasize our generality and the unique superiority of the engine algorithm. JoinBase is implemented so fast that you can use it without caring performance downgrade.\nMore queries and notes are seen in here.\nConclusion\nLet's do a quick rating: from 0 to 5, 5 is the best, and 0 is the worst:\nDatabase ServiceEase of UseCompleteness of ServiceAnalytical Query PerformanceBuilt-in IoT Domain Capability\nJoinBase Cloud Preview5Full55\nTimescale Cloud3Full11\nClickHouse Playground4Demo51\n?DB Demo5Demo01\nInfluxDB Cloud1Fulln/a1\nCockroachDB Cloud1Fulln/a1\n\n Tab.5 Final Ratings for Reviewed Database Services\n\nFor Timescale cloud, in fact, the first user experience is a little tricky: the service password was wanted in notes, but we found nothing till the service created (or we miss something?). Finally, we found a workaround that the password could be changed in the service settings.\nFor Ease of Use, JoinBase is the cloud service shipped with SQL workbench. You can experience JoinBase immediately after registering without any installation. Timescale cloud and ClickHouse demo are headless so that you need install consoles for going on.\nBuilt-in IoT domain capability is the unique features of JoinBase now. So nothing is done in this review. Feel free to explore these features in our free JoinBase Cloud Preview.\n\nThis experiments is great: it is much much easier to review a cloud service or demo than a formal benchmark with many codes and setups. \nFinally, all reviews or benchmarks are biased. It is suggested that users should reproduce yourself. Welcome to register our free JoinBase Cloud Preview for reproducing!\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/blog/clouds-quick-reivew/","title":"Quick Review for Free Database Cloud Services on Real World IoT Dataset"},"https://joinbase.io/blog/hello-joinbase/":{"body":"","id":"https://joinbase.io/blog/hello-joinbase/","title":"Hello, JoinBase!"},"https://joinbase.io/blog/http-interface/":{"body":"HTTP Interface\nIn the existing databases, there are very few databases that can natively support HTTP interface. This brings up a problem: if users want to provide REST services based on these databases, they need to combine other HTTP services on the top of current databases.\nThe HTTP interface is an effort of JoinBase to prompt the end-to-end experience for its users. See the HTTP version of quick-start:\n\n      \n      \n      \n      Tips: you can copy the command from the cast, paste the command into your shell to execute!\n\nIn the above cast, a simple read-write-read REST based flow has been demonstrated:\n\nCombine the SQL and HTTP client, you can do all data works under the PostgreSQL wire protocol. If you are a frontend developer, just work with curl is enough. A database console like psql or mysql is not needed any more.\nThe HTTP interface also supports the batch data ingestion like in the MQTT interface.\nIt is a piece of cake to integrate with your own tools or apps. Just your own REST style.\n\nQuick Benchmark\nAnother of big problem of HTTP protocol is that it is verbose and low efficient for the high performance application layer. Most database authors lack the performance optimization practice for the transport layer. This is another reason why the HTTP interface is not popular in the database community.\nHowever, JoinBase, as built from scratch, fixes this problem. The authors of JoinBase are practiced with modern software optimizations for full stack in the long time. This time, we bring a top performance HTTP interface for our users like that done for the MQTT interface implementation previously.\nThe HTTP benchmark tools are very mature now. Here, we just pick up the great tool - wrk, for the quick benchmark. We use another popular database with HTTP interface support - ClickHouse, as the comparison object.\nWe build the wrk from latest head to and use ClickHouse latest stable version 22.9.7.34. The hardware is based on a single socket with Intel Xeon Platinum 8260 which has 48 hyper-threads. So the benchmark thread number of wrk is 24 threads. Benchmarking on a single node will lead to the competition for running resources. So, such a benchmark is not very rigorous. But, in our experience, the results are quantitatively acceptable from the view of comparison. Because, for all benchmark subjects, the environment and client configs are the same. And the running resource is reserved for both the client and the server.\nJust jump to some interesting results:\n\nHTTP Ping \n\n\n\n HTTP ping bench with wrk \n\nThis ping bench is for evaluating the intrinsic HTTP protocol implementation performance. The throughput of JoinBase ping is around ~25x faster than that of ClickHouse ping. The performance of JoinBase ping stands for the performance with a small message interaction. It is great to see that, even some conservative optimizations in the first release, JoinBase can reach 1.6 million HTTP requests/response per second. Although, this performance is not matched against 7 million mps in our MQTT interface. But the record of MQTT interface is done for QoS=0, the implementation of HTTP interface is equivalent to the QoS=1 level of MQTT interface.\nThere is another interesting difference between JoinBase and almost other databases: an authentication information must be provided to all the JoinBase interface before using. So, you can not use JoinBase before setting up a user/password. But common DBMSs, like ClickHouse, PostgreSQL and MySQL, allow default user which often results in silent compromises in the real world.\n\nHTTP Pipelined Ping \n\nOne interesting feature of wrk is that wrk supports the HTTP pipelining. JoinBase's HTTP interface does not fully optimize for HTTP pipelining. Because, in the IoT scenario, the client pipelining makes non-sense and most clients does not support pipelining.\nBut JoinBase implements all the HTTP interface features from the scratch. This makes JoinBase can control all the aspects of implementation. We just make a tiny change to allow JoinBase can correctly handle the pipelined requests.\nLet see the result:\n\n\n HTTP pipelined ping bench with wrk \n\nClearly, our pipeline implementation boosts the throughput to 3 million requests per second, which is ~2x of the non-pipelined case (and ~50x of that of ClickHouse ping). On the contrary, ClickHouse does not support the pipelined HTTP requests at all. So, all the socket connections suck in the bench. \n\nHTTP Based Select Query\n\nLet's roll a further non-trivial case into the benchmark: do one plain query via the HTTP interface.\nDue to that JoinBase use the HTTP body to carry the query, we use the following simple script for wrk benching. For the ClickHouse, it supports to put the query text in the uri's parameters, so the direct wrk command is OK to run. (The ugly is that you need to escape necessary characters in the uri, which is not for human-beings.)\n\n\n Simple wrk script for benching JoinBase \n\n\n\n HTTP based select query bench with wrk \n\nThe bench result is very profound: the performance of JoinBase HTTP based simple query is ~100x that of ClickHouse. JoinBase crushes the ClickHouse in this query scenario! JoinBase truly have a unique base, you can't achieve an order of magnitude performance improvement with the copycat.\nWe have more non-trivial queries shown in our benchmark page's concurrency benching section. Here, the HTTP interface itself is not the bottleneck of the performance, so they share the same excellent outcome. It is also encouraged our users to repeat the bench yourself.\n\"JoinBase's HTTP interface is so fast that you can use it to provide unlimited production-level REST services without any worry.\"\nWebSocket Interface\nWebSocket interface is also available from now. And a new webAssembly based high performance interface is experimented in the interface implementation. If you are interesting, feel free to request the free JoinBase.\nMulti-protocol Ecosystem\n\n\n Multi-protocol Ecosystem of JoinBase \n\nWith the HTTP interface up, the end-to-end experience has been enabled for any time-series data services. So, JoinBase becomes a more general time-series optimized database.\nThe HTTP interface is one long waiting feature requested by the community. Now we just complete this feature for our community. And we are interesting more interfaces, for example, the green-colored words in the above picture. But we don't have enough information right now to confirm whether implementing them is necessary. If you are interested in these or other protocols/interfaces, please join our community!\nFinally, all interfaces in JoinBase has two modes: plain and secured. It is found that the secured transports are usually implemented within 80%+ performance of the plain transports. (More benchmarks of secured transports will be shown in the future.). JoinBases only recommend to use secured transports in the production in that the secured transports are fast enough.\nExtensions\nFrom this release, JoinBase start to support three types of extensions: UDM(User Defined Mapping), UDF(User Defined Function) and UDVF(User Defined Vector Function). Through these extensions, JB solves the problem of user-defined logic hooking in main aspects. Let's discuss the UDM as the example.\nSome of our users say that it is hard to change the message payload themselves because the end devices are bought from 3rd party vendor. The UDM extension just come to solve this problem. \nIn the first release of JoinBase, like some MQTT brokers or databases, JoinBase has supported a rule based mapping. But the real-world JSON payload is arbitrarily nested, the simple rule based way is not enough to solve the arbitrarily complex payload mapping. Most brokers or databases just stop here. Some databases, like MongoDB or PostgreSQL, support the store the JSON or its variants directly. The price is that the query and analysis performance drops by orders of magnitude.\nJoinBase solves this problem by integrating a message stream processing/mapping engine into the database. Just image that you have an embedded Kafka in JoinBase. The difference for JoinBase is that we push the processing engine into the top performance in that all components in JoinBase are organically integrated together in the zero-abstraction, zero-copy and zero-allocation style.\nA real-world complex session based message mapping extension has been provided for one of our energy IoT users in the form of UDM. Interestingly, the UDM extension can be more efficient than that of general rule based mapping engine, since you can provide a much simplified custom logic in your UDM.\nIf you are interesting, feel free to request the latest free JoinBase.\nTopic Aliases\nSome of our users say that it is hard to change the message topic as well because the end devices are from 3rd party vendor. From this release, JoinBase start to support one feature called Topic Aliases.\nWith topic aliases, You can mapping any topic/path into the normalized topic in JoinBase. This is done by simply setting the mappings in the conf file. For example, the following lines in the conf,\n[topic.aliases]\n\"/abc/sensors\" = [\"/edge/x2view/1234567890/some_deeper_uri_path\"]\n\"/abc/sensors\" = [\"/edge/x2view/0123456789/another_deeper_uri_path\"]\n\nTwo paths \"/edge/x2view/1234567890/some_deeper_uri_path\" and \"/edge/x2view/0123456789/another_deeper_uri_path\" are mapped to one single normalized topic \"/abc/sensors\" which is equivalent to the database entity \"abc.sensors\". All messages sent to the two long topics will go to the database table \"abc.sensors\".\nOne More Thing\nJoinBase provides lots of values beyond the peers of this era.

Because we find that there is not a simple, flexible, high performance tool or framework to help benchmarking an IoT end-to-end data stack. To enable a concise end-to-end experience is important for in-production data systems. Because a full IoT data stack may be complex, there can be a huge gap between the local sub-system and the global system.\nMake Benchmark Fast and Simple\n\nComposable Commands\nOne key design of OIDBS is: composable commands. \nThe benchmark suite consists of three commands: gen, import and bench. \n\ngen: to generate the controlled, reproducible message data to files on disks in CSV or JSON format.\nimport: to import the CSV or JSON format files to the MQTT brokers or PostgreSQL/Timescale servers.\nbench: run preset SQL queries on specific targets.\n\nThese three composable commands decouple main capabilities of various IoT and data scenarios. And the decoupling makes the benchmark faster and less overhead. For example, if the message is generated in-place in the hot loop to send the message, the data calculating and filling must interfere with sending.\nHierarchical Pluggability\nFor maximum external understanding and contribution, we offer pluggable designs at various levels with minimal architecture. The whole OIDBS is easily to be extended from the data source formats, the transport protocols to backend servers via standard interfaces.\nBenchmark Models\nThe concept, benchmark model, has been proposed to the core of OIDBS extensions. A benchmark model is used for grouping different benchmark dataset and its corresponding data-gens, schemas, queries.\nIn the first launch of JoinBase and OIDBS, two models - 'nyct_lite' and 'nyct_strip' are benched: \nmodel namemodel dataset sizedescriptionhow to get\nnyct_lite10906860 rowsNew York City Dataset used in official Timescale  (compressed in one 424MB file)Timescale Docs\nnyct_strip1000000000 rowsExtended 1-billion-row New York City Dataset with stripped columns (compressed in 13GB files)download pre-made from mediafire  or  prepare from this github project\n\n Tab.1 OIDBS models introduction \nThese two models are derived from official, real-world New York city dataset. More about why these two models proposed could be seen in the JoinBase's benchmark page.\nDemo\nLet's watch a simple example about how to use OIDBS to benchmark the throughput of the latest Mosquitto release in minutes. This video is also a great, quick-start demo for how to use the Mosquitto with its own client.\n\n\n\n Video: Quick Start to OIDBS \nFrom the result of this demo, we can see that the performance of the forward throughput of the current Mosquitto release in WSL2(Ubuntu) with one-pub-one-sub is 10906860 messages / 43.48 seconds ~= 250K mps or 1.6GB / 43.48 seconds ~= 36MB(in csv format)/s.\nHowever, the 250k messages/s with localhost is not good because one-pub-one-sub means the concurrency of connections is one. More importantly, we must point out that, the Windows environment is not suitable for benchmarking a MQTT broker, not mention that WSL2 is essentially a virtual machine. Here, we just show how easy to use the OIDBS benchmark. Because there is no difference between Linux and Windows WSL2 in the workflow. For non-production usages, this Windows setup is still acceptable.\nOne More Thing\nFinally, we are proud to point out that, for the same 1 connection concurrency condition, our JoinBase is still 30% faster than that of Mosquitto. But please note that, in JoinBase, we do many many heavy ultra works, including message parsing, message transferring, data computing and storing. In the near future, We will demo that, under the extreme pressure of OIDBS, the overwhelming performance advantage of JoinBase over the existing mainstream MQTT brokers, and welcome everyone to request our free distribution. \nA new TPCx-IoT inspired benchmark model will be released soon.

In 2023, we are adding new and more exciting AI infra into JoinBase. This makes the final binary size increased by 80% to 8MB.\nMost lightweight and fastest data platform for AIoT\nRecently, we have re-run our benchmark against the latest ClickHouse's stable version 22.9.7.34 (which is the last stable version in 2022). The primitive benchmark results have not changed (but some details should be added or tweaked). This is a true story that 8MB binary beats 410MB ClickHouse binary in large-scale time-series. It's a triumph of modern performance engineering.\nLet's recap JoinBase's power:\nComparisonJoinBase 2023.1ClickHouse 22.9.7.34References\nmain binary size～8MB～410 MBProducts Download\nbasic SQL analyticsaverage 3.5x - 3.75x faster1x baselineBenchmark\nIoT protocol interfaceBlog: Multi-protocol Interfaces  Doc: MQTT Interface\nIoT gatewayJoinBase As MQTT Broker  Doc: MQTT Interface\nHTTP interface concurrent read throughput~100x higher (402k/s)1x baseline (4.3k/s)Blog: Multi-protocol Interfaces\nPG interface concurrent read throughput~130x higher (34k/s)1x baseline (245)Benchmark\nsustained one-by-one MQTT message write throughput7 million msg/sBenchmark\nsustained batch MQTT message write throughput25 million msg/s  (NVME write bandwidth saturated!)Benchmark\nsustained one-by-one and batch HTTP message write throughputon par with MQTT interfacelowinternally tested, to be demonstrated\ndedicated support to low-codeBlog: SmartBase\nend-to-end platformBlog: SmartBase\n\nWhy you should use JoinBase\nOf course, as a general analytical data warehouse, ClickHouse provides many functions that JoinBase does not have.  However, for AIoT, most of these functions are not must-have. JoinBase provides AIoT and time-series domain with new simple but efficient real-time paradigms through innovative designs, like auto views. (Watch issue#8).\nAchievement 2022\nIn addition to above technological progresses, we have also made great achievements in products and users. \nSince the global launch of JoinBase in October 2022, we have received overwhelming requests from totally 33 users applied our free distribution on the website. We're thrilled to see that some of these users are from big giants and give us much positive feedbacks. Some of them told me that they are using JoinBase in the daily development and even in production!\nBecause of these achievements, we decided to open the download from now on, to make the interaction flywheel between the product and the community faster. \nRoadmap 2023\nWe have already laid out our roadmap for the year (Watch issue#9):\nMore supports to the community\nJoinBase 2023 has added more supports to the community, making it easier for users to find the information and help they need. The platform has a strong community of AIoT engineers, database developers, and high-performance experts who are always on hand to assist users with their needs.\nLike issue#11.\nMore diverse analytics infrastructure\nJoinBase plans to add even more analysis functions in 2023 to enhance its offerings to customers. These new functions will make it easier to extract insights from your AIoT data and make real-time decisions. For example, sampling support.\nLike issue#16.\nFewer concepts to use it\nJoinBase has re-designed the workflow with simplicity in its core, requiring fewer concepts for users to fully utilize its capabilities. This makes it easy for users of all levels to access and use the platform's data services, without the need for extensive training or technical know-how. \nNowadays, in order to maximize performance, you need to understand the concept of partitioning. For most distributed databases, even single-node databases, you need to learn this concept if you want to achieve good performance. But as a new data platform, we think this can actually be improved. We plan to hide this concept for users recent 2023, and still provide top performance. This is just the issue about auto-partitioning.\nLike issue#7. \nBrand new AI infrastructure\nRecently, the popularity of ChatGPT has shown the impact of AI-based evolution on the world. JoinBase also wants to showcase our thoughts and works about AI. That is the \"A\" of AIoT stands for! More information is expected to be available in Q1 and Q2 of 2023.\nLike issue#6.\nWish to Open-source\nAt JoinBase, we come from one open-source database/data-warehouse community where we have done amazing works. However, balancing business and open-source is a tough nut to crack, as the resources needed to maintain an open-source project in today's world are substantial, and competition between communities is no longer based on technical innovation but on community engineering. As a start-up and believers in technical innovation, we can't take it. \nHowever, our dedication to the technical progress of the world remains unchanged. In the time of download opening, I make a wish here: gradually open source the core of JoinBase within 2 years, if the company goes well. It is our sincere wish that the JoinBase community grows and flourishes along with us, and together, we can make this dream a reality.\nStart to download and experience the power of JoinBase, right now!\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/blog/joinbase-2023/","title":"JoinBase's 2023: Revolutionizing AIoT Data Services for the World"},"https://joinbase.io/blog/joinbase-as-mqtt-broker/":{"body":"Quick Intro\n\n\n IoT data made simple with JoinBase! \n\nJoinBase is a free all-in-one data stack built around our unique and innovative database technologies. \nWe are committed to simplifying the IoT data pipeline while delivering the highest production efficiency. By lowering the consumption threshold of IoT data, we believe that JoinBase can benefit every organization and individual in this era.\nWhy Built-in Broker\nThe answer is, not only the built-in broker! \nThe IoT data and data stack are expanding violently, and out of control for many enterprises. JoinBase wants to change this.\nWe plan to add more interesting IoT scenario simplifications and integrations in JoinBase to allow developers to build IoT data systems by using one or two simple techniques which they are familiar with, from zero to planetary scale.\nEarly Access Stressing\n\n\n Let's stress! \n\nIn order to observe the performance of each brokers under the ultimate pressure, we, again like our OIDBS, create a new fastest stressing/benchmarking tool called MQTTBT. In this new stressing tool, the total end-to-end ingestion throughput is proposed to evaluate. We will publish a dedicated blog article for introducing this tool soon (you can always request it in the community in advance).\nThe following the stressing process and the result of JoinBase 2022.11 in in 2p-1s (2 publisher to 1 subscriber):\n\n\n Stressing process and the result of JoinBase 2022.11 (gif) \n\nSurprisingly, it is found that many popular brokers, like EMQX and HiveMQ CE, can not pass our stress tool under non-trivial QoS=0 ingestion connections. \nWhen the pressure exceeds their capacity, EMQX will disconnect the subscribers, HiveMQ CE will drop outgoing messages even for 1p-1s. Ridiculously, for the lack of right documents, we still can not figure out how to config them to work under non-trivial ingestion connections after hours searching.\nAlthough the message in QoS=0 is not guaranteed by the spec, the tacklings of these brokers are not IoT scenario friendly. (We discuss the good design in the later section.) \nIn the real-world IoT scenario, the sensor value is generated continuously, one loss point is not important, but QoS=0 provides 10x best performance than QoS=1. If the connection is lost, you just lose the in-flight message, which is usually one for that client. JoinBase guarantees that if the connection is reliable, the message even with QoS=0 is guaranteed to be stored reliably (assumed that the OS is running normally). Also in JoinBase, millions of connections and millions of messages are unified without any compromises. This brings more possibilities and greater flexibility to the design of large-scale IoT data transport networks.\n\n\n Stressing process and the result of EMQX (gif) \n\nThe above gif is the EMQX stressing process and result in 2p-1s. It is easy to find that the performance of the JoinBase 2022.11 is ~5x faster than that of one popular broker EMQX (5.0.9) in the same stressing condition. The HiveMQ even does not pass our stressing in any p-s combination.\nWe will present a detailed benchmark report in the near future.\nSafety and Privacy\nIn benchmarking, we find that EMQX at least silently reads all disk infos in current system, like:\n2022-11-07T12:53:19.340116+00:00 [notice] alarm_handler: {set,{{disk_almost_full,\"/data/n4\"},[]}}\n\nHere, /data/n4 is an unused disk in the system, but EMQX is put in another disk with nothing about knowing /data/n4 in conf. Futhermore, EMQX enables its telemetry by default, like many other open-source products (for example, VSCode or TimescaleDB).\nWe strongly recommend that any infrastructure product should not collect any user information without explicit permission.\nJoinBase keeps highest standard in the field of product safety and privacy:\n\n\nJoinBase do not silently write any data to the disk of users or any location of the Web.\nAll data directories must be specified in the conf file. And we suggest you change to your onw directories at the first get started document.\n\n\nYou can do nothing to JoinBase if you do not create a dedicated user.\nIn fact, the core philosophy of JoinBase is allow-list based. All external interactions are checked explicitly. You must create a new user to use JoinBase. (Don't worry, it is so quick). Compromises that often occur on other databases by the default initial configuration never happen in JoinBase. \n\n\nJoinBase do not send any data out to any Web location.\nAnd JoinBase do not do any non-user-business background works, like telemetry. On the contrary, many distributions of open source projects collect various user information by default.\n\n\nThink Time\n\n\n Why is JoinBase faster? \n\nWe don't want to fire any war between languages or systems. Here, we just show some thoughts under the hood which users should know to construct a performance critical engineering:\n\nPerformance is largely independent of language, provided the language and system keep wise in its design.\n\nOf course, to make one language and system kept wise is hard. \nHere, JoinBase is done in Rust, correspondingly EMQX is done in Erlang and HiveMQ CE is done in Java. \nErlang is an interesting language to provide wide features to enable Erlang based network application programming easier. Java use GC to make developer happy without worries about memory safety. However, there is no free lunch. Features come with kinds of prices inevitably.\nThe Rust philosophy, conversely, is KISS. All the things like actors or hot-swappiness should and could be done in the external mechanism. JoinBase follows the Rust philosophy and built from scratch. We keep every call in great engineering and performance shape for our users. We even fix the broken message channel in recent Rust standard library. Yes, even official language standard library has problems! Don't rely blindly!\n\nCorrect design philosophy is important for your business\n\nOne common problem HiveMQ CE and EMQX mentioned in above section is that, they are not resilient enough under stressful situations. \nThe right reaction under high load is back-pressure. From the kernel to the application layer, we have many opportunities to do this kind of transport back-pressure. Blindly killing connection or messages is the ugliest choice. It makes the system highly underutilized, and more importantly, unavailable in high pressure.\nComing Soon\n\nStress/benchmark mainstream brokers with open-source tools.\n\nAny benchmark which can not be reproduced is meaningless. Any benchmark without apple-to-apple comparison is meaningless as well. We are responsible for providing insights to all IoT users on how to choose high performance data system. \nWe will release the complete benchmark report in the near future. Stay tuned!\n\nBeyond the interoperability between database and MQTT.\n\nIn JoinBase, we have made the Topic concept in MQTT and the Table concept in database exchangeable. Soon, we will enable the query capability via MQTT subscribing. This shows how we greatly push both two communities by creating a new work pattern!\n\nAny great idea proposed by users in the community issues.\n\nMore Links\nGet your IoT infrastructure one step ahead with free JoinBase by request latest free JoinBase.\nTalk with JoinBase developers in the Discord server.\nWatch or submit your ideas in the community.\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/blog/joinbase-as-mqtt-broker/","title":"JoinBase 2022.11: An IoT Database with Built-in MQTT Broker"},"https://joinbase.io/blog/pstations/":{"body":"Problems\n\n How to benchmark the internet of things? \nIoT scenarios are increasingly becoming scalable. From the case of big giants like that Apple which needs handling hundreds of million Apple watches to that of one small individual who just wants to build up a homebrew animal monitoring system. \nMotivation\nIn OIDBS, we have solved the methodologies of benchmark. Nextly, we may pick up for a nice data model. Two New York City taxi dataset based models have been proposed. The problem of them is, that they are fixed external data sources. A scalable and fast enough model is needed for the scalable IoT scenarios as mentioned.\nGenerally, any data sources can be chosen to do the benchmark. But it is better to refer to any useful previous work in that a real-world inspired model reduce the understanding resistance to the benchmark of users.\nTPCx-IoT Screwed Up\n\n How to benchmark the internet of things? \nTPCx-IoT is a benchmark for IoT gateway systems proposed by TPC org. But it has many problems:\n\n\nThis benchmark is not user oriented but commercial vendor oriented.\nLike other \"notorious\" benchmarks proposed by TPC (for example, TPC-H and TPC-DS), the hardware is provided per vendor, different hardwares plus different softwares with \"dedicated optimizations\" make the result ranking totally no sense.\n\n\nThis benchmark is mainly for benching data system for IoT.\nThere is no gateway ingestion interfaces considered in the spec. Then the benchmark in transporting is not standardized, which leaves the benchmark capabilities of this ingesting or importing suspectable.\nAlthough  is mentioned in the spec, but there is one main-stream MQTT gateway used in the kit.\n\n\nThe benchmark is complex. Not explicit pluggablity and extensibility in the benchmark kit. If a benchmark is hard to repeat, it just makes nonsense.\n\n\nPstations in OIDBS Comes\n\n Do you know the power grid of California has 3,200 power substations in around 2017? \nPstations is an OIDBS model adapted from the power substations model of TPCx-IoT. The workflow of benchmark framework is still that of OIDBS, but the data features and scenarios are based on those power substations.\nPstations model is simple actually. Let us do a concise understanding via the following schema creation SQL:\ncreate table benchmark.pstations\n(\n    station_id UInt32,\n    sensor_id UInt8,\n    sensor_kind UInt8,\n    sensor_value Float32,\n    ts DateTime\n)\npartition BY ymdh(ts);\n\nHere, the schema is only for understanding model because from the message to the table record is simply a 1-1 mapping.\nThe model pstations contains 5 fields: station_id, sensor_id, sensor_kind, sensor_value and ts. The model objects consists of two-level object: stations(the short of substations) and sensors. In a real-world configurations, it may have thousands of stations, and hundreds of sensors. This means that it is very reasonable for even 1 million sensoring points per second. This is the biggest characteristic of the TPCx-IoT model which has been reserved by pstations.\nIn the model pstations, we use a maximum flexibility schema. That is, the type of sensor is recorded by the sensor_kind field. So, you can extend sensor types as much as possible (here, is limit to max 256 by UInt8 type). \nOne point is that it is possible to use Enum-like types here. But the Enum-like type is a database concept, other IoT data systems, like message brokers, do not have such concept. So, for no barriers to understanding for all users, we just use the plain integer ids to represent the objects in the model.\nGet more details from the sources of the OIDBS project.\nHow to Use\nJust a one-liner is used to generate a CSV format pstations model data file:\noidbs -- gen OUTPUT_PATH -w 1 -i 2 -m '{\"num_sensors\":2,\"num_stations\":4}' -o\n\nHere is the table of parameters:\nparametermeanings\nOUTPUT_PATHthe only mandatory parameter for output file path, please change to your own path.\n-wthe number of generation workers. In the same time, it decides the number of output files, then decides the ingesting/importing concurrency.\n-ithe time interval per worker to gen in seconds, the default is 1 second. Note that the time interval is per worker means that different workers generate the records in different time spans.\n-mthe model parameters, in the model specific json string format, the default is empty json object. In the pstations model, there are two model parameters: num_sensors and num_stations. We can not specific these parameters in advance in the fixed parameter list, because the number of models is unlimited.\n-othe flag to enable output out of order. It doesn't make much sense for the brokers, because brokers do not care the ordering of messages before their incoming.  This is mainly for benching the end-to-end data stack with databases in the pipeline. We will demonstrate out-of-order messaging could have a huge performance impact on databases in the pipeline in the future.\n\nPstations Edge-100m\nRecently, we are preparing an Edge Data Stack Capabilities Ranking for the world (WIP). The interesting results will be discussed in that dedicated page when comes out.\nBecause from low-end SBCs(Single-board computers) to high-end edge nodes, the performance gap is two or more orders of magnitude. The existed external NYC taxi dataset model is either too big or too small. That's exactly what pstations came to solve.\nHere, we just proposed a pstations edge-100m for the edge scenarios, which could be generated with the following OIDBS command:\noidbs -- gen OUTPUT_PATH -w 10000 -i 100 -m '{\"num_sensors\":10,\"num_stations\":10}' -o\n\nhere, we have ten sensors in every ten stations will generate 10000 files with 100 seconds time in the echo file's time span. The total rows of records in the pstations edge-100m is 100 millions which is the stem of edge-100m naming.\nDemo\n\n      \n      \n      \n      Tips: you can copy the command from the cast, paste the command into your shell to execute!\n\nHere, it is interesting to find that we generate the 3.4GB pstations edge-100m dataset in 3.88s in this machine. A modern tool built for the modern hardwares makes our lives easier!\nPlease see the demo in the introduction article about how to import the generated model's data against your MQTT brokers or IoT data stacks like JoinBase.\nOutlook\nThe pstations model can be strengthened in some places. For example, we use a biased random data distribution for the fields, maybe more distributions could be tested. In the future, we hope more real-world inspired models can be added into the OIDBS to make benchmarks covering more dedicated scenarios.\nOne of most important near episodes is the upcoming Edge Data Stack Capabilities Ranking. The capabilities of edge computing systems will be rolled out within modern IoT data stack perspectives, from the smallest 4.2cm*4.2cm SBC to the largest hundreds-of-cores bare metal server.\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/blog/pstations/","title":"Pstations: TPCx-IoT Inspired IoT Data Benchmark Model for OIDBS"},"https://joinbase.io/blog/smartbase/":{"body":"Why Yet Another IoT Dashboard\n\n\n Where the dashboard will take us? \n\nBecause we want IoT users to have more and better choices.\nCurrently there are existed IoT dashboards, like ThingsBoard and Datacake.

Some are open source, but they may be started from the feature oriented engineering and lack enough performance for the real world.

However, in real scenarios, there is no significant practice of learning details in software side on top of products to show, and this paper makes up for this deficiency.\nAt the same time, this project provides a complete and reproducible work flow of EdgeML/TinyML for animal recognition on one cheap edge AI hardware, which is rare in existing projects as known.\nHardware\n\n\nWio terminal and Grove AI Module in SenseCAP K1100 kit\n\nThe project's hardware is the Grove Vision AI Module in Seeed SenseCAP K1100/A1100. There is standalone version of Grove Vision AI Module in the official store.\nThe Vision AI Module has a chip: Himax HX6537-A. The mcu on the chip is based on the ARC arch which is unfamiliar to consumers. The main frequence is 400Mhz which is also not high. But the most interesting that the HX6537-A, has fast XY SDRAM memory architecture to accelerate the TinyML, like tensorflow lite model inferenece. We will see the performance of this chip later.\nWorkflow\n\n\nWorkflow for TinyAnimal\n\nThe above workflow is common and clear. We only discuss some interesting requirements:\n\nThe dataset is the public dataset with 9.6GB images.\n\nThis avoids the common problem of too few samples or insufficient representativeness.\n\nThe training is completed locally.\n\nThis avoids the common problem of too few samples or insufficient representativeness.\n\nThe data collection and realtime analysis is done via an edge database JoinBase.\n\nUnlike the common databases like PostgreSQL or TimescaleDB, the JoinBase accept the MQTT message directly. Unlike the cloud service, the JoinBase support run in the edge which can be used in an environment without a network. Finally, the JoinBase is free for the commerical use which is also nice for further development of the edge platform.\nPrepare Dataset\n\n\nOverall of \"animials-80\" dataset\n\nAt present, there is not much public research on the workedge AI for wildlifes or animals. One of the few publicly available animal datasets - Animals Detection Images Dataset from Kaggle (called \"animials-80\" dataset ) has been used. It contains 80 animals in 9.6GB images, and should be great enough for common animal recognition task.\nPrepare Training Data\nThe good thing of animals-80 dataset is that it has been labeled itself. But the original label format is not Yolov5 label format. A preparation work has been carried on it. The core part is the preprocessing function shown above. Please the later code repo for more.\nTrain\nBecause we don't have enough resources to do a full training on full 9.6GB training. So, a picked subset of animials-80 dataset has been choosen.\n\n15-animal Subset Training\n\n\n\n15-animal subset training\n\nWe use a 24c/48T Xeon Platinum 8260 Processor to do the training using above the commands got from offical example.\npython3 train.py --img 192 --batch 32 --epochs 200 --data data/animal.yaml --cfg yolov5n6-xiao.yaml --weights yolov5n6-xiao.pt --name animals --cache --project runs/train2\n\nHowever, after two hours (Yes, it proves again that Don't use CPU to train even it is a top Xeon SP), the final recognition effect is found to be very poor.\n\nThe main metrics are very low: the precision is 0.6, the recall and mAP_0.5 are just around 0.3.\n\nIn fact, this result is close to not working.\n\n4-animal Subset Training\n\nLet's reduce the types of recognized animals to four: spider, duck, magpie and butterfly, which of course are the most common animals in a suburban wild area.\nNote, to re-run the preparing script to generate correct data/animal.yaml.\n\n\n4-animal subset training\n\n\nThe main metrics become better: the precision is ~0.81, the recall and mAP_0.5 are around 0.6.\n\nWe will review the performance of this model in the late inference trials and evalutions. It is possible to do only a binary categorization: one animal and no animal. But in this project, I look forward to evaluating the recognition effect in more complex scenes.\n\n4-animal Subset Training by YoLov5Official Pretrain Model\n\nThe above trainings are done by the Seeed's official document's recommend. The pretrained model is yolov5n6-xiao which may lack good generalization ability. In this project, we try a YoLOv5 official smallest pretrained model yolov5n6 to see whether there is some difference.\n\n\n4-animal subset training with offical yolov5n6 model\n\nThe above result is obtained from the official yolov5n6 model with epochs=150. The result is great. Because,\n\nThe main metrics: the precision, the recall and mAP_0, 5 are all larger than 0.9. In the ML, the difference in mAP_0.5 between 0.6 and 0.9 is huge and huge in real-world detection.\n\nUnfortunately, the final model trained based on the official yolov5n6 is close to 4MB, while the Grove AI module has the constraint model size no more than 1MB. So, we can not make use of any such bigger models (tried). Some suggestions will be discussed in the final section.Inference\n\n\nThree examples of detections in the simulation\n\nAfter the above traning, we do a picture based simulation to preliminarily evalute the effect of the model. Let's see examples.\nThe above is the output of Grove AI module. The index of classification is in the middle and the confidence is around the side. The animal name of coressponding index can be seen in above training figures.\nThe first and second detection are right in a nice confidence and the third detection is wrong. The third picture shows a magpie fly in the sky and the inference result is the butterfly. We just see the impact of this classification model in the later real-wprld evalution.\nReal-world Evaluation\nInferencing in real world is more challenging than inferencing in laboratory. Because the environment or the status of the tester or the tested object under the test can all have a big impact on the results. That is why we are planning in the workflow section.\nWe have done a real-world evaluation via a country park wildlife survey in the project TinyWild. Two types of detections are carried out:\n\nDynamic Viewport (Moving Camera) Based Detection\n\n\n\nClassification statistics (with confidence &gt; 75) in the whole survey\n\nThe above figure is the classification statistics (with confidence &gt; 75) in the whole survey. There is a large time in which the camera is moving. So, this is a dynamic viewport (moving camera) based detection. \"Unkown\" and empty animal which stems from the software logics has been excluded here.\nThe basic conclusion is that, for individual identification, it is not particularly ideal, but the qualitative information collected is effective.\n\nBufferfly is relatively outstanding in the statistics but without Magpie that've seen many times in the park.\n\nThis seems the Magpie are been recongized as the bufferfly as shown in the analysis of the Inference section above. What they have in common is that, they often flys in the air. Three real-world factors: moving camera, moving objects and low resolution, have a great impact on the recognition results.\n\nStatic Viewport (Static Camera) Based Detection\n\nTo reduce impact of moving factors, a dedicated wild duck (mallard) observation in the lakeide has been carried out as well.\n\n\nPrimary process of the static wild duck observation\n\nIn the above first of captures, the count of duck in our frontend UI (one of interesting in this is that the dynamic table in UI is driven by a SQL query, please see our more infos in future projects) is 10. Suddenly, two ducks swims into the scope of camera. The count of duck has been increased to 13. Considering the orignal duck is counted, the 13 is the exacting count at that moment. It is found that the Grove AI works greatly for nearby animal detection like we done in lakeside: we got three counts when suddenly three ducks swims into the scope of camera in a relative static positioning. (note: in the TinyWild project, we said there are four counts, but it should be corrected to three counts according to our recordings.)\nIdeas\nBased on the above pratices, we give out the following suggestions for EdgeML or TinyML on a cheap edge AI hardware:\n\nTry to observe statically\n\ni.e. observers do not make large movements.\n\nDetect as few objects as possible\n\nFor example, only do the binary categorization: people or nobody, monkey or no monkey, bird or no bird.\n\nMake main metrics of model as large as possible\n\nFor example, the precision &gt; 0.8, the recall and mAP_0.5 &gt; 0.6.\n\nImprove recognition accuracy as possible (like, longer training time)\n\nThe cheap edge ML hardware usally has the limited resources, for example, Grove AI module has the constraint model size no more than 1MB, which falls below the model size trained from the yolov5's official yolov5n pre-trained network. The smaller model is found to significantly affect the model's primary metrics.\nCode\nTinyAnimal 's modified yolov5-swift repo\nTinyAnimal 's modified Wio Terminal firmware and related\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/blog/tinyanimal/","title":"TinyAnimal: Animal Recognition Practices on Grove Vision AI"},"https://joinbase.io/blog/tinywild/":{"body":"Problems and Challenges in The Wild\n\nThe wild without a reliable internet connection\nMany wild ecosystems do not have good network connections, and it is difficult for data analysis systems that rely on the cloud to work well in such wildlife-rich scenarios. Furthermore, such cloud-based systems are usually so expensive that wildlife researchers or institutions cannot afford.\nIoT Devices\nEdge Dev Kit\nIn the data stack, a SenseCap K1100 kit is used. We use two modules from this kit:\n\n\nWio terminal: it can be seen as a handheld data hub with a visualization interface, which can manage various sensor modules and even display simple sensor data charts.\n\n\nGrove AI module: it provides TinyML-based wildlife recognition in the TinyWild.\n\n\nGrove Vision AI for Animals Detection\nThis is a very great but challenging task. On-the-edge AI has a profound impact on the intelligence in the wild, because there is no good network in the wild to connect to cloud services with unlimited computing power.\nAt present, there is not much public research on the edge AI for wildlife or animals. Let us do a deep customization for this tasks:\n\nAnimal-80 dataset\nOne of the few publicly available animal datasets - Animals Detection Images Dataset from Kaggle (called \"animials-80\" dataset ) has been used. It contains 80 animals in 9.6GB images, and should be great enough for common animal recogization task.\n\n\nPrepare images and lables for Yolov5 training\nThanks to the Kaggle's working, we do not need to do labeling ourself. But the original label format in the animals-80 is not Yolov5 format. A preparation work has been carried by me on it. The core part is the preprocessing function shown above. Please the later Code section for more. \n\n\nTraining\nUnfortunately, I don't have enough resources to do a full training on full 9.6GB training. So, a picked subset of animal-80 dataset has been chosen. We use a 24-core Xeon SP to do the training using above the commands got from offical example.\n\n15-animal-kinds training\n\n\n Training result for 15-animal-kinds\nFirstly, we try train a model with 15 animal kinds. However, after two hours (Yes, it proves again that Don't use CPU to train even it is a top Xeon SP), the final recognition effect is found to be very poor. You can see the main metrics are very low: the precision is 0.6, the recall and mAP_0.5 are just around 0.3. In fact, this result is close to not working.\n\n4-animal-kinds training\n\n\n Training result for 4-animal-kinds\nLet's reduce the types of recognized animals to four: spider, duck, magpie and butterfly, which of course are the most common animals in a suburban wild area.\nOk, the recall and mAP_0.5 are upward to around 0.6. Not too bad. We will see the result in the late TinyWild's Wildlife Survey.\n\n\nJoinBase as No-coding On-the-Edge IoT Data Stack\nThe core of TinyWild is, an free on-the-edge IoT data stack - JoinBase.\nNowadays, it is impossible to run MQTT broker + database + no-coding visualization at one resource constrained edge. JoinBase just comes as a game changer.\nUnlike existed IoT for wild solutions, with the help of JoinBase's edge-cloud-in-one architecture, the TinyWild gives out a wildlife diversity real-time monitoring and analysis system reference implementation in low cost, high availability and great scalability, from UI to data analysis on the edge.\nAll done in the wild. No network connection to cloud any more needed for data analysis, even if you are in the African savannah to observe the rhinoceros. Our TinyWild system is especially suitable for real-world wildlife research.\nPack All Being the TinyWild\n\nTinyWild in 1/4-palm Size\nServer Side Coding\nThe JoinBase data stack used by TinyWild is a all-in-one\nWe just write a SQL schema to create a table in the JoinBase like you do it in the your traditional database:\ncreate table iot_into_the_wild.sensors (\n  ts DateTime,\n  light Int16,\n  sound Int16,\n  imu_x Int16,\n  imu_y Int16,\n  imu_z Int16,\n  animal String,\n  confidence Int8\n)\nPARTITION BY yyyymmdd(ts);\n\nThen, it is enough to start to service device messagings, no more codes. More usages about JoinBase could be seen in its own website.\nClient Side Coding\nIn the client side, we change SenseCap's official no-coding tooling SenseCraft to make Wio termial to work with an edge data stack.\nThree main contributions are done in the TinyWild development, compared to the official version of SenseCraft:\n\n\nDynamic sensor-join-in/out for a wide database table has been supported.\n\n\nMQTT and Sampler thread event loop has been enhanced.\n\n\nProperly calibrated realtime clock has been supported via RTC and rpcWiFi libray.\n\n\nMore details could be seen in the related repo in reference.\nAfter main coding done, TinyWild is ready for using. Finally, let recap the size of TinyWild parts:\nDevicesSize\nWio Terminal72mm * 57mm * 12mm\nSBC - Rock Pi S42mm * 42mm\nSolar Charger30.5cm * 18cm\n\nThe total size of TinyWild is 305mm x 180mm by the largest part - solar charger, of which the size is just to that of a book.\nThat is why it named: Tiny. Let's go to Wild!\nWildlife Survey in the Wetland Park\nFor evaluating the TinyWild, I go to the country park to complete a wildlife survey.\nLocation\nWe start from the wetland lake in the center of park but keep on running till we're back where we started in the entrance of the park.\nContinuous Monitoring\nThe continuous monitoring is done by running plain SQL queries. JoinBase provides a trial free cross-platform frontend for all users to allow periodically running queries and show then as dynamic tables or charts.\nThe monitoring queries running in TinyWild are as following:\nselect count(ts) as number_of_records from iot_into_the_wild.sensors;\nselect animal,count(animal) as number_of_animal from iot_into_the_wild.sensors group by animal;\nselect count(animal) as number_of_highly_true_ducks from iot_into_the_wild.sensors where animal = 'Duck' and confidence &gt; 70;\nselect count(light) as number_of_great_sunlight from iot_into_the_wild.sensors where light &gt; 900;\nselect count(light) as number_of_near_lightless from iot_into_the_wild.sensors where light &lt; 50;\n\nStatic observation on Duck\n\nStatic observation on duck in the lakeside\nThere are wild ducks (mallards) in the lake. To test the static recognition performance of Grove AI module, the camera is been pinned to lakeside for around half an hour via a tripod. See more results below.\nData Analysis to the Wildlife Survey\n\nJoinBase powered TinyWild goes into the wild\nIt is time to evaluate the performance of Grove AI and whole TinyWild system\nGrove AI for Wildlife Recognition\nIn the basic conclusion of this wildlife survey, for individual identification, it is not particularly ideal. But, for survey, the qualitative information collected is effective.\nlet's observe the whole survey group-by (in the third picture above) query:\n\nGroup-by SQL query result of the whole-survey monitoring sensoring values\n\n\nMost of animals are \"Unkown\"\nBecause it is found hat the outputs of Grove AI have a great possiblity with the confidence 100 (100% for short) even for its own built-in (people detection) model. This is impossible. So we treat all confidence &gt;= 100 detection as \"Unkown\".\n\n\nEmpty \"animal\" in the results\nThis stems from the logics of database storage model and that of SenseCap's no-coding SenseCraft in that our TinyWild's Wio terminal codes are modified from it: the data logic will send data in a timer interval then clear the input buffer, if the buffer can not filled by sensors then for single point, you can easily ignore it but for a row of points like show in the TinyWild database table, we still need to something here.\n\n\nSo, change to see the records with high confidence, here &gt; 75 in the query:\n\nGroup-by SQL query result of high confidence classification\n\nCharting of high confidence classification\nButterflies are relatively outstanding but without Magpies that have seen many times in the park.\nThis seems the Magpies are been recognized as the butterflies. But what they have in common is that, they often fly in the air.\nDuck are observed in the lake side. In the records, we exactly found that the Grove AI works greatly for nearby animal detection like we done in lakeside: we got four counts when suddenly three ducks swims into the scope of camera in a relative static positioning.\nContinuous Collection\nFor the great portable and mobility of the TinyWild, let's look at another case: continuous light sensoring in the edge:\n\nCharting of continuous light sensoring in the whole \nWhen I went back ( @ 17:09 ) after survey at the lakeside done, I go through a big tree road ( after 16-17mins according to the recoding ). The above figure is the plot of light sensor values at the last 22 mins of the return journey.\nThe TinyWild completely and accurately recorded of the entire changes of light sensors while the entire cameraman is moving all the time, many times the network is poor.\nCost Analysis\nTinyWild is tiny and wild(no cloud needed). It is also cheap:\nDevicesSize\nSenseCap K1100$0 (free give-out from Seeed)\nSBC - Rock Pi S$15\nSolar Charger$38\n\nThe parts of observation endpoints like iPad or laptop are not included here. Because they are replaceable with any have-screen endpoints with the web access capability. For example, an unused phone. I have three unused phones and one unused pad...\nThe total cost of TinyWild is $53, and you can reduce the solar charger to a much cheaper common charger if you are not working too long in the wild.\nOutlook\n\n\nEdge LoRaWan Gateway\nThe work related to adding LoRaWan gateway to JoinBase server and TinyWild is in progress. We promise to have support for LoRa Gateways in a few weeks. \nAfter that, JoinBase will be the world's first data stack with MQTT and LoRaWan dual-gateway supporting, and can uniquely run on $15 SBC with a 3MB binary at the same time.\n\n\nMore Accurate Edge AI\nFor the recognition of a small-kinds, short-range, low-speed objects, Grove AI has shown good results. However, if let Grove AI module to interfence with 15-animal-kinds model, it is found the runtime latency is larger than 1ms. And it is alsos observed that the overheating hot loop may cause the module to hang.\n\n\nSo, to make better use of Grove AI module well, more community practices are needed.\nReference\n[1] EdgeML codes in this article\n[2] TinyWild open-source repo\n[3] Article on Hackster\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/blog/tinywild/","title":"TinyWild: JoinBase Makes Wild IoT in Your Hand"},"https://joinbase.io/blog/tips-1/":{"body":"Get JoinBase\nOperating system\nCurrently, JoinBase supports Linux distributions with modern kernels, such as the latest Ubuntu 20.04.4+ LTS .

This brings up a problem: If users want to provide REST services based on these databases, they need to combine other HTTP services on top of the existing databases. \nBasic knowledge\nHTTP API\nFirst introduce the concept of API, Application Programming Interface (application programming interface) is its full name. The simple understanding is that API is an interface. So what kind of interface is it? Now we often regard it as an HTTP interface, that is, HTTP API. That is to say, this interface has to be called through HTTP.\nSay we have an application that allows us to view, create, edit and delete widgets, we can create HTTP APIs that allow us to perform these functions.\nBut what's the inconvenience of doing this? This way of writing the API has a disadvantage, that is, there is no unified style, which will cause other people who use our interface to have to refer to the API to know how it works.\nDon't worry, REST will solve this problem for us.\nWhat is REST?\nWith the above introduction, you may also have an intuitive understanding. To put it bluntly, REST is a style!\nThe role of REST is to directly map the view (view), create (create), edit (edit) and delete (delete) we mentioned above to the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods that have been implemented in HTTP.\nAfter this change, the API becomes unified, and we only need to change the request method to complete related operations, which greatly simplifies the difficulty of understanding our interface and becomes easy to call.\nThat's what REST is all about!\nPreparation\nThe HTTP interface is JoinBase's effort to facilitate the user's end-to-end experience.\nFirst, refer to our quick start tutorial, create a JoinBase account, and complete the operations in the article.\nAfter you follow the above steps, simple data is inserted into JoinBase.\nAlso don't forget to execute the following command to install curl, which is a prerequisite for us to use the HTTP interface.\nsudo snap install curl\n\nUse the HTTP interface\nAt this point, let's experience the HTTP interface. This section will demonstrate a simple REST-based process for reading and writing.\nEnter the above command to see our previous table creation\n\n\n\n\nLet's change the way and enter the following command to view the previously created table using the HTTP interface\ncurl -s -H 'X-JoinBase-User: tips' -H 'X-JoinBase-Key: 123456' -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/?database=jb_tips' -d 'desc table t'|json_pp;\n\ngot the answer:\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, enter the following commands to use the HTTP interface to insert data into the database.\nNow, we insert the data \"3,4\":\ncurl -s -H 'X-JoinBase-User: tips' -H 'X-JoinBase-Key: 123456'  -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/jb_tips/t' -d '3,4\n\nNext, let's try query operations.\nExecute the following commands to query.\ncurl -s -H 'X-JoinBase-User: tips' -H 'X-JoinBase-Key: 123456' -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/?database=jb_tips' -d 'select * from jb_tips.t'|json_pp;\n\nnote: \"|json_pp\" at the end of this command can help us see the query results more intuitively in the format of the json file .

The csv file is composed of any number of records, one row is a row of the data table, and the fields of the generated data table are separated by half-width commas, and the file stores the tabular data (numbers and texts) in plain text. Plain text means that the file is a sequence of characters and contains no data that must be interpreted like binary numbers .\nImport CSV dataset\nFirst, we prepare the CSV data file.

We will continue to update the license and explore ways to benefit this era.)\n(Author 2: the word open source in this article refers to OSI(Open Source Initiative) defined open source unless bolded and quoted \"open source\")\nOpen Source Dilemma\nAs a long-term open source participant and a founder of tech company, I think around a question over and over again: how a startup can be built successfully with both open source and business?\n\nIs MongoDB successful? \n\nHowever, MongoDB, four years ago changed its license to the Server Side Public License (SSPL), which is not an OSI approved open-source license.\n\nIs the company Databricks behind Apache Spark successful? \n\nThis company has reached $38 billion post-money valuation after the H series of Databricks. However, the company's core native query engine - Photon is not open sourced. Its open-source project under Apache License has a long time not to compete with its data analysis competitors in the performance, like ClickHouse.\nIt is obvious that, no matter how these startups say they are \"open source\", the true interesting sources are not available for the business organizations. In fact,\nOpen source is an anti-pattern to the business\nSource codes are the core asset of a software company, no matter you are open source or closed source. Open-source means that you share the ownership of that asset to the world. Open core means you you share the ownership of that core asset to the world. \nWhen the open source antis its business competitors, it antis itself in business as well.\nApache License is dead for infra startups\nCockroachDB, TimescaleDB, Redis, and Confluent all changed their license for all or some parts of their platform from open source to source-available.\nTwo months ago, Akka, which is an old and well-known actor library used in many important Java/Scala infras, changed from the open-source Apache License to the source-available Business Source License (BSL). If one open-source project can't establish a good business in 13 years, it is really hard to expect more.\nOne week ago, the author of Mold linker, which is a low-level high performance linker tool, expressed his thoughts on changing the license.\nObviously, the world enjoys such Apache License like permissive licenses, but not give deserved returns to the developers behind these licenses.\nApache License is truly dead for infra startups.\nCloud is not the savior\nFirstly, cloud vendors host open source based services is the direct reason of above companies change their licenses.\nSecondly, to enable cloud native service does not change any above open source anti-pattern to the business. Everyone can host the cloud service with the source, not mentioned that they can change the source to make the service better.\nPerhaps, the big tech giants are encouraged to continue to open source their infrastructures under the Apache License in that they have a responsibility to give back to the society.\nFor current open source startups, they surely has encountered the business dilemma. \nUSAL (User Source Available License)\nNot only by encouraging technological innovation of infra startups, but also benefiting all individuals and commercial organizations in this era, I believe that \"open source\" need to adapt itself to the business better. \nUser Source Available License (USAL) is proposed to address this problem.\nCore of the USAL\nUser centric\nOnly users of the product are granted with the right of the product's source codes. \nCommercial-friendly\nUnlike the BSL which limits the production use, the USAL explicitly allows production use. It is more like the Apache License without (re)distribution right. \nCompatible with all kinds of other licenses\nYou can change to a more permissive license if you think you can control all the ecosystem, or provide a commercial license when big giants want to use it.\nWorkflow of the USAL licensing\nThe USAL licensing can be done with a workflow rather than the one-time licensing. \n\n\n The Common Workflow of the USAL \n\nOne great common workflow is like this: \n\nThe people or organizations to request and evaluate the free product firstly. \nThe people or organizations become users when they decide the product fits for them.\nThe users request the USAL licensed sources for further interests or concerns.\nThe licensor distributes the USAL licensed sources to the users.\nThe users do customizing, contributing or any other USAL license allowed things.\n\nBenefits of the USAL\nStrong operability\nThe change date concept of BSL seemly makes a good trade-off, but one real-world big project may have millions of commits. In practice, it is impossible to judge the exact change date for a particular piece of sources.\nThe license is clear that you can anything to the licensed sources except the (re)distribution.\nStrong objective and business scalability\nThe USAL is user centric. You only distribute the licensed sources to your users. These users are strongly targeted. After making sure that they are users of your product, you grant the right of sourcing to users in their business without any copycat. \nWith USAL, the advantages of Apache License are inherited, while the disadvantages of Apache License are avoided.\nStrong contributions to the times\nAll the people and business in this era still freely get and adapt the sources to their business under the permissive USAL. The biggest contribution of current permissive open source licenses for business innovations in this era is kept. \nBSL breaks the greatest feat of open source, USAL fixes it.\nSource available should be the part of Open Source\nThe OSI(Open Source Initiative)'s Open Source Definition has been out of the pace of the times. \n\n\"Absolute power corrupts absolutely\"   - Lord Acton\n\nHere, for open source, absolute open may go to its opposite as well.\nLet's use the USAL to pave a new path for the business of \"open source\".\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/blog/usal/","title":"USAL: A New Source Available License"},"https://joinbase.io/careers/":{"body":"\nJoin us","id":"https://joinbase.io/careers/","title":"Join Us"},"https://joinbase.io/cloud/":{"body":"\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n            Sorry.

We only expose the minimal concepts that must be known by users in current technical conditions. Apart from this, you don't need any other data field knowledge to use JoinBase well.\nSQL\nIn JoinBase, you are only required to understand the plain SQL. Considering the declarative nature of SQL, as design, you basically only need intuition to use JoinBase well. \nAlso based on this, for SQL, we do not plan to copy it all into JoinBase's language. We will make compatible with its most intuitive parts, discard the unintuitive parts, and expand the parts that it has not yet done, but should be done simpler and more intuitive as a great bigdata analysis tools.\n Partition\nFor the IoT scenario, the data generated by devices can be regarded as endless. Therefore, putting all the data into one place is neither necessary nor practical. \nA partition in JoinBase is just a part of data or records which is sliced by your specified partition expression on a column or a list of columns when creating the schema of the table.\nFurthermore, a partition in JoinBase act as an unit of data skipping for reducing query's scanned dataset. By skipping un-interested partitions, you can make your query lighting fast even the total dataset in the database is unlimited. We have carefully built an engine that can resist most of the pathological partition shapes. But wrong partition schemas may still greatly affect query performance. Because the great real-world flexibility on the top of the JoinBase's general SQL model, we think it is better to expose the concept of partition to users currently.\nRelated to partition, the following concepts you should know to create a correct schema,\n\nPartition Keys\n\nPartitioning of a table should be based on the table's data. Commonly you use one or multiple columns in the table. These selected columns are the so-called partition keys.\nCurrently, we only support the single column as a partition key. And the value of partition must be a unsigned 64bit integer. In the future, we will support the multiple columns as a compound partition key.\n\nPartition Expression\n\nSometimes, it is not  convenient to just use the column’s value itself. Instead, it is better to use the derived value from the column. \nFor example, it is natural to partition the time series table by a kind of time unit, like a day. But you may have only a Timestamp type column in your table.  There are two ways for solving this:\n\nYou add a new column like date as the partition key to represent the day partition granularity.\nIt will be easier if you just tell the databases how to calculate the partition key (in the day partition granularity) from the existing timestamp. This is the so-called partition expression.\n\nFor performance and security reasons, we support several common functions (mainly date-time related) to be used as partition expressions. See the language reference page for more detail. \nCurrently, you may combine two above ways if you want one much complex partition schema. We will continue to improve the partition expressions support.\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/docs/references/concept/","title":"Concepts"},"https://joinbase.io/docs/references/conf/":{"body":"In JoinBase, we hope to that was extremely complex and difficult to control in the traditional database system or big data platform.\nPhilosophy of JoinBase's Config\nConfig should be done in:\n\nall-in-one place\nshow main configurable items that the system exposes to users \nself-explained\nreasonable default value\n\nYou can use the above standards to configure JoinBase in the $JoinBase_HOME/base.conf (toml format file).\nNoteworthy\nThe only item in conf file you should change in the first time is:\n\ndirectories of your data, schema, log and WAL(Write-Ahead Logging).\n\nBecause JoinBase is a database system.

In contrast, the end-to-end IoT database, like JoinBase, supports data (a.k.a. domain messages)to be directly written to the end of data sink (a.k.a. the database) from the end of data production sources (a.k.a. devices).\nAn end-to-end database is proposed, by us, as an out-of-the-box database for non-professional domain users. The end-to-end database evolves through user orientated characteristics, not based on technical features.\nMore formally, an end-to-end database meets the following 3E standards:\n\nEdge native. For IoT domain, direct message ingestion from end devices to end databases without any intermediate components involved.\nEdge elasticity. For IoT domain, both cloud end and edge end are deployable for main three stream CPU architectures without any functionality compromise.\nEdge friendly. All necessary pipelines are provided for end users without any DBA required.\n\nIoT Native\nIn JoinBase, MQTT messages becomes the first-class citizen of database. We support ten million concurrent physical connections from massive IoT (Internet of Things) devices to ingest near ten million one-by-one messages in one node. The whole database is built and optimized for unlimited IoT bigdata. \nIn all databases, we know the internet of things best.\nDevOps Free\nIn JoinBase, we carefully craft a dedicate database for unlimited IoT bigdata. You don't need a dedicated JoinBase administrator (a.k.a. DBA) to maintain the JoinBase. The system is designed to work in a highly fault-tolerant manner, and can automatically recover from most errors. \nIoT Natural ACID\nACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties of database transactions to guarantee that the data system can work properly in all situations. \nUsually databases use some specific statements to group multiple statements as a single atomic unit, a.k.a. transaction. It is obvious that， there is a significant performance cost to supporting arbitrary transactions in general data systems. \nIn JoinBase, we support a subset of general ACID transaction, IoT Natural ACID transaction called by us: the single-row write transaction in read committed isolation level. Every single-row message written into JoinBase is taken as an implicit transaction. And JoinBase does not provide any explicit transaction control statement now. The IoT Natural ACID enables a special consistency model: causal consistency. That is, we guarantee the messages and their data effect from the same client are in the order. So, if there are causalities in all kinds of IoT events, you can still make causal inferences based on data effects.\nIn the IoT domain, the messages from different clients are not related. So, it doesn't make sense to provide complex composable transactions here. Although richer ACID options may be provided in the future, it is believed that IoT Natural ACID transaction as the default transaction behavior is the best choice for IoT domain users.\nIn JoinBase, one message may be mapped to one row or more rows by JSON array flattening. But the message flattening is deterministic, so the single-row transaction model is still applied for the deterministic splitting rows.\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/docs/references/glossary/","title":"Glossary"},"https://joinbase.io/docs/references/ha/":{"body":"Asynchronous Replication\nJoinBase has experimental support for the asynchronous primary-secondary replication. \n\n\n\n Asynchronous Replication Diagram \nThe key here is, the data/messgae/write can only be sent to the primary node, but the query/read can be sent to any one.\nCompared with that of other databases, the asynchronous replication implementation of JoinBase has the following unique advantages：\n\n\nAlmost Zero Overhead\nThe secondary nodes have little performance impact on the primary, as long as the number of secondary nodes is not too crazy (for example, less than 1000 nodes).\n\n\nUp-to-Sub-Second Latency\nThis makes out of sync data interval very tiny or no if your message ingestion frequency is not too crazy (for example, sub-second-frequency ingestion).\n\n\nScale-out-able Query Capabilities\nJoinBase makes platform-type users to expand their query capabilities without any worry. Note, our single-node primary has supported near ten-millions connections and messages per second. \n\n\nDevOps Free (of course)\nJust config several parameters in your conf, all happens automatically.\n\n\nSynchronous Replication\nIt is believed that the JoinBase's extreme performance asynchronous replication is enough for IoT domain users. However, in theory, the asynchronous replication can not guarantee 100% data safety. When a permanent failure for the primary node occurs (the primary node can not come back after some major failure), out of sync data data may be lost. \nPlease note, out of sync data data in non-permanent failures still survives greatly with the asynchronous replication. As an example, an AWS instance with EBS volume is practically considered to have no permanent failure.\nJoinBase does not provide the synchronous replication option now. Because the synchronous replication causes orders of magnitude performance degradation, which most of databases will not tell you. And, for the IoT data, data durability failures in the very tiny probability (a.k.a., permanent failure case) are often tolerable. Please recall the design principle of the MQTT protocol.\nIf you really want the effect of synchronous replication, one MQTT messaging based solution proposed: dual/multiple active primary runnings. That is, clients send multiple messages to dual/multiple active primary nodes. For using this solution, the message's QoS should be 1. JoinBase honors QoS 1, which reliably persists messages in the server side. \nA new innovative clustering mechanism is in the progress for more elastic high availability guarantee options.

Feel free to ask help from us and the community. \nFinally, JoinBase is evolving rapidly. This language document is continuing to be improved based on the latest progress.\nSyntax\n\nData Types\nData TypesDescriptionSupport Status\nInt8/Int16/Int32/Int64Integer✅\nUInt8/UInt16/UInt32Unsigned integer✅\nFloat32/Float64IEEE 754 float point number✅\nStringVariable-length UTF8 string✅\nBlobVariable-length binary data block✅\nDate32-bit date, days since UNIX epoch 1970-01-01✅\nDateTimetimestamp with an optional timezone, measured as a Unix epoch. The time zone is a string indicating the name of a time zone, either a time zone offset form \"+XX:XX\" or \"-XX:XX\", such as +07:30, or \"Region/City\" such as \"America/New_York\". If timezone is not provided, the server timezone (configurable via JoinBase conf file) will be used.✅\nDecimalSigned fixed-point big numbers with precision and scale. For division least significant digits are discarded (not rounded).✅\nBooleanboolean true or false✅\nFixedStringFixed-length string of N bytes.✅\nEnum8Enum16Dictionary type, by manually mapping a low cardinality type to another type.  It is highly recommended to use this to boost the query performance if you have low cardinality String columns.✅\n\nTyped Literals\nLiterals for primary types like integer or string is well established. For advanced types, like datetime, the traditional implicit pure string representations are subtle and error-prone.\nTo avoid ambiguity and enhance the maintainability of the language, not like some SQL dialects, single quoted string literal in the JoinBase is just for the String type. On the contrary, we favor typed literals for advanced literal, that is: type prefix + string representation of that type.\nDateTime TypesExample\nDateTimeform#1: datetime'2001-01-01 01:01:01'(this form will use server defined time zone) form#2: datetime'2001-01-01 01:01:01+08:00'(this form use the time zone defined in the literal)   datetime prefix can be reduced to dt, like dt'2001-01-01 01:01:01' for short.\nDatedate'2001-01-01'  for short, d'2001-01-01'\nTimetime'01:01:01'  for short, t'01:01:01'\nFixedStringfs(10)'abc123' There the type prefix has a parameter for specifying the byte width of FixedString type. Because the FixedString data has a fixed length. The width parameter is used for padding its string representation.  If the byte width is not provided, the length of its string representation will be used. That is, fs'abc123' is the short form of fs(6)'abc123'. See more in the note below.\n\nNote \n\nNot like Postgresql, JoinBase only have one timezone-wared DateTime type. It is recommended that you use the default timezone of JoinBase, which is the time zone of the JoinBase server. But you can specify the time zone in anywhere needed.\nDate and Time type are not related the time zones, it just plain date and time. If you need timezone wared behavior, you just use DateTime type.\nFixedString data in the JoinBase is fixed length. For the shorter string representation, it is necessary to pad the representation to the fixed length (with zero). For the longer string representation, the excess trailing will be truncated away. To enhance the ergonomics, for the representation which you can not need to pad, you can omit the width parameter, like fs'abc123'. \n\nData Definition, Manipulation and Management\n\ncreate database \n\nCREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db_name\n\n\ncreate table\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS [db_name.]table_name\n(\n    a Nullable(UInt32),\n    b Int64\n)\nPARTITION BY toYYYYMM(ts)\n\nItemNote\nNullableA nullable column is explicitly defined with Nullable container type.\nPARTITION BYPARTITION BY clause is used to specify the partition key and partition expression of this table. Currently, only one column can be used as the partition key and only the specific functions can be used for the partition expression. All specific functions are listed below. It is planed to extend this feature to allow the complex expression combinations in the future.\n\nAllowed specific partition functions:\nFunction NameDescriptionNum of Arguments\nno function, a.k.a. just one raw column.1\nyyyyget the year from a Date or DateTime value as 4-digit integer1\nyyyymmget the year, month from a Date or DateTime value as 6-digit integer1\nyyyymmddget the year, month and day from a Date or DateTime value as 8-digit integer1\nyyyymmdd10/yyyymmdd7/yyyymmdd3variant of yyyymmdd with DateTime type, but the interval gap is 10/7/3-day1\nymdhget the year, month, day, hour from a DateTime value as 10-digit integer1\nymdh2/ymdh4/ymdh6/ymdh12variant of ymdh with DateTime type, but the interval gap is 2/4/6/12-hour1\nremreminder of an Int-like types1\n\nNOTE\nFor more performance-ergonomic, all no-nullable types (this is the default case) in the CREATE TABLE statement has a default value: empty string for String, 0 for int-like and float-like, false for boolean, and unix epoch timestamp 0 (ISO 8601: 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z) for Date and DateTime. It is allow to use default constraint to change the default value if necessary. See more for performance tunning.\n\nshow databases\n\nSHOW DATABASES\n\n\nshow tables\n\nSHOW TABLES IN db_name\n\n\nshow create table\n\nSHOW CREATE TABLE [db_name.]table_name\n\n\ndesc table\n\nDESC TABLE [db_name.]table_name\n\n\ndrop database \n\nDROP DATABASE IF EXISTS db_name\n\n\ndrop table\n\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS [db_name.]table_name\n\n\ntruncate table \n\nTRUNCATE TABLE IF EXISTS [db_name.]table_name\n\n\ninsert into\n\nINSERT INTO [db_name.]table VALUES (v11, v12, v13), (v21, v22, v23), ...\n\n\nuse database\n\nUSE db_name\n\nQuery\n\ngeneral form\n\nSELECT expr_list\n[FROM [db.]table]\n[WHERE PARTS range_list/last_subclause]\n[WHERE expr]\n[GROUP BY expr_list]\n[ORDER BY expr_list]\n[LIMIT n]\n\nItemNote\nWHERE PARTS clauseThis clause is an unique JoinBase extension to the standard SQL, related to the core concept of JoinBase - Partition.   This clause allows the user to explicitly specify the query partitions to reduce scanning dataset and accelerate query. *\nSelect clauseselect count(1) from table is not currently supported. You can use select count(some_column) from table as the workaround.\n\n\nCurrently, WHERE PARTS supports two subclause forms:\n\n\nrange_list. The range_list consists of one or more comma separated ranges. A range is one of as follow:\n\none number, like 123;\n\n\nhalf open number interval, start..end, start..end contains all values with start &lt;= x &lt; end, like 123..456;\n\n\nclose number interval, start..=end, start..=end contains all values with start &lt;= x &lt;= end, like 123..=456;\n\n\n\nlast_subclause. The last_subclause is used to specify the last number of partitions which you can query against without providing latest partition key because it is varying with time, like last or last 10. This form is very useful for querying latest data in the time based partitions. Note, last is just a short form to last 1.\n\n\n\n\nFunction Reference\n\nAggregation\nItemDetail\nFunction Namecount, max, min, avg, sum, all, any\nDescriptionaggregation functions\nTypeaggregation\n\nMath\nItemDetail\nFunction Nameabs, power, floor, ceil, ln, log10, log2, cos, acos, sin, asin, tan, atan\nDescriptionmath related functions\nTypescalar\n\nPrimitive\nItemDetail\nFunction Nameint32, int64, uint32, uint64, float32, float64\nDescriptionexplicit prompt other compatible types into this type\nTypescalar\n\nString\nItemDetail\nFunction Nameutf8_is_alpha, utf8_is_decimal, utf8_is_digit, utf8_is_lower, utf8_is_upper, utf8_is_numeric, utf8_is_space, string_is_ascii\nDescriptiontesting functions for String\nTypescalar\n\nItemDetail\nFunction Nameutf8_length, utf8_capitalize, utf8_lower, utf8_upper, utf8_reverse, utf8_ltrim, utf8_rtrim, utf8_trim, starts_with, ends_with, find_substring, count_substring\nDescriptionString related functions\nTypescalar\n\nBlob(Binary)\nItemDetail\nFunction Namebinary_length, find_substring\nDescriptionBlob(Binary) related functions\nTypescalar\n\nDateTime\nItemDetail\nFunction Nameyyyy/year,yyyymm,ymd/date,ymdh,ymdhm,ymdhms,month,weekday,day,hour,minute,second\nDescriptionDateTime related functions\nTypescalar\n\nOther Test\nItemDetail\nFunction Nameis_finite, is_inf, is_nan\nDescriptiontest functions for Floats\nTypescalar\n\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/docs/references/lang/","title":"Language"},"https://joinbase.io/docs/references/mapping/":{"body":"Payload\nJoinBase supports two built-in kinds of payload in the body of HTTP/MQTT message: CSV and JSON. Futhermore, via the mechanism of UDM(User Defined Mapping), JoinBase can support the arbitrary user defined mapping logic. \nMapping Mechanisms\nAutomatic Mapping\nThe automatic mapping is very simple and direct: the top-level JSON field name corresponds directly to the table column name.\n\n🔍\nYou do not need to provide any explicit mapping definition, if you can design one simple 1-1 mapping enabled message payload in advance.\n\nLet's see an example:\n\nConnect the test JoinBase server.\n\n$ psql -U username -d test_db -h 127.0.0.1\n\n\nCreate a database and a simple table without any explicit mapping attribute.\n\n&gt; create database test_db;\n&gt; create table test_tab(ci8 Int8, cu64 Int64, cts DateTime);\n\n\nWrite a corresponding data to the JoinBase default MQTT broker by Mosquitto tool 1.\n\nin CSV:\n$ mosquitto_pub -d -t /test_db/test_tab -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -u username -P password -m '-1,123456,2021-09-08T13:42:29+08:00'\n\nin JSON:\n$ mosquitto_pub -d -t /test_db/test_tab -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -u username -P password -m '{\"ci8\":-1,\"cu64\":123456,\"cts\":\"2021-09-08T13:42:29+08:00\"}'\n\n\nCheck the written data.\n\n&gt; select * from test_tab;\n ci8 |         cts         | cu64 \n-----+---------------------+------\n  -1 | 2021-09-08 13:42:29 |  100\n(1 row)\n\n\n🔍\nBatched message ingestion: payload in CSV supports multiple lines as multiple records into the table.\n\nRule Based Mapping\nIf you message payload design does not follow the default automatic mapping rule, you can explicitly specify your mapping logics via one mapping rule definition language.\nThe rule definition language is simple and JSON Pointer inspired.\nThe rule definition language is specified in the table attribute name JSON_MAPPINGS when you create the table schema. You can change the JSON_MAPPINGS attribute in the latter with alter command.\nLet see an example JSON_MAPPINGS attribute:\nJSON_MAPPINGS ci8 &lt;- '/a/b', cu64 &lt;- '/c/0', cts &lt;- '/d/1/e'\n\nthe key points of the JSON_MAPPINGS table attribute:\n\nThe entry ci8 &lt;- '/a/b' just defines a mapping from the JSON Pointer path pattern '/a/b' to the table column named ci8. That is, the value of column ci8 will be extracted from the JSON message's path '/a/b'. \nIf no mapping defined in this, it is still assumed the table column will be extracted via default mapping. \n\n\n🔍\nUnlike a file system, the \"/\" query in JSON Pointer does not identify the root. Instead, \"\" is the root and \"/\" is the child of the root whose key is the empty string. Similarly, \"/xyz\" and \"/xyz/\" are two different nodes.\n\n1-1 Mapping\nIf your JSON message has no dynamic array, then 1-1 mapping rule definition is enough.\nLet's see an example:\n\nCreate a test table based the path pattern syntax\n\ncreate table test_tab1(\n  ci8 Int8, cu64 Int64, cts DateTime\n) \nJSON_MAPPINGS ci8 &lt;- '/a/b', cu64 &lt;- '/c/0', cts &lt;- '/d/1/e';\n\n\nWrite a corresponding JSON data by the JoinBase default MQTT broker.\n\n$ mosquitto_pub -d -t /test_db/test_tab1 -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -u username -P password -m '{\"a\":{\"b\": -1},\"c\": [100],\"d\":[\"\", {\"e\": \"2021-09-08T13:42:29\"}]}'\n\n\nCheck the written data.\n\n&gt; select * from test_tab1;\n ci8 |         cts         | cu64 \n-----+---------------------+------\n  -1 | 2021-09-08 13:42:29 |  100\n(1 row)\n\nDynamic Array Flattening\nFor JSON message with the dynamic array, JoinBase's rule definition language provides a flattening mapping pattern syntax: one and only one array now can be flatten into multiple table records via wildcard symbol *.\n\n🔍\nDynamics will compromise the performance. When you can control the format of message, 1-1 mapping will provide better performance.\n\nLet's see a quick example about how dynamic array flattening help us:\n\nA sample JSON message:\n\n{\n  \"timestamp\": 1636666666,\n  \"dev_id\": \"id-01\",\n  \"dev_name\": \"abc\",\n  \"data\": [\n    [\n      1,\n      25.1\n    ],\n    [\n      2,\n      25.5\n    ],\n    [\n      3,\n      25.9\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n\n\nCreate a test table based the path pattern syntax:\n\ncreate table sensors(\n  timestamp DateTime, \n  dev_id String, \n  dev_name String,\n  sensor_id UInt32,\n  value Float32\n) \nJSON_MAPPINGS \n    timestamp &lt;- '/timestamp', \n    dev_id &lt;- '/dev_id', \n    dev_name &lt;- '/dev_name',\n    sensor_id &lt;- '/data/*/0',\n    value &lt;- '/data/*/1';    \n\n\nSend the above sample message:\n\nmosquitto_pub -d -t /abc/sensors -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -u abc -P abc -m '{\"timestamp\":1636666666,\"dev_id\":\"id-01\",\"dev_name\":\"abc\",\"data\":[[1,25.1],[2,25.5],[3,25.9]]}'\n\n\nCheck the saved records in JoinBase:\n\nabc=&gt; select * from sensors;\n dev_id | dev_name | sensor_id |      timestamp      | value \n--------+----------+-----------+---------------------+-------\n id-01  | abc      |         1 | 2021-11-12 05:37:46 |  25.1\n id-01  | abc      |         2 | 2021-11-12 05:37:46 |  25.5\n id-01  | abc      |         3 | 2021-11-12 05:37:46 |  25.9\n(3 rows)\n\nThe biggest difference between 1-1 mapping and dynamic array flattening is that, one JSON message has been flattened into 3 rows/records in the table. The data array's inner arrays' first element goes to the sensor_id field separately, and inner arrays' second element goes to the value field separately.\nUser Defined Mapping\nArbitrary user defined mapping logic is supported via JoinBase's .\nVia the mechanism of UDM(User Defined Mapping), JoinBase can support the arbitrary user defined mapping logic. For example, you can use Protocol Buffers or FlatBuffers binary message format in your payload if you like.\n\n1\nmosquitto_pub is a simple MQTT command line tool, you can get it here.\n\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/docs/references/mapping/","title":"Payload Mapping"},"https://joinbase.io/docs/references/mgmt/":{"body":"Management\nAfter config, you can start the server of JoinBase:\n./joinbase_start\n\nThe JoinBase server will listen on multiple ports to accept connections with different protocols.\nTo gracefully stop the server of JoinBase:\n./joinbase_stop\n\nAdministration\n base_admin\nbase_admin is a tool to do the UDAC(User and Device Access Control) of JoinBase.\n\ncreate_user\n\nUse subcommand create_user creates a user with specific username and password:\nbase_admin create_user abc abc\n\n\nlist_users\n\nUse subcommand list_users to check the users:\nbase_admin list_users\n\n\nhelp\n\nFor all tools in JoinBase, you will get help from subcommand help.\nbase_admin help\n\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/docs/references/mgmt/","title":"Management"},"https://joinbase.io/docs/references/mqtt/":{"body":"A built-in MQTT broker capacity is implemented in JoinBase.

The basic principle is： \n\nkeep the size of partition between tens of thousand rows and tens of million rows as possible;\nfor time series data, partitioning using natural time units (day, hour, minute) is a good practice;\nuse WHERE PARTITIONS/PARTS clause to narrow down your query dataset as possible to accelerate your queries speed directly and effectively unless your full table size is small\n\nDenormalization\nDenormalization is a good practice to keep if you are working on the big data. The speed of single-table query and multi-table join may differ by hundreds or even tens of thousands of times.\n\nas possible mapping json to wide-row table schema rather than using the opaque String or container types.\nas possible use Enum type for long String fields when data redundancy and denormalization used.\nas possible trade space for time because the modern storage is cheap. For example, assumed that you have a frequently-used expression in the queries, it is good to derive a new column with this expression and use this column in the queries directly.\n\nData Type\nChoosing the right data type may greatly improve your storage and query efficiency.\n\nuse Enum and Dict type rather than String type if your String like column has a small variance in its contents (a.k.a., low cardinality).\nuse No-nullable types with default values (such as '', 0, etc) rather than Nullable types (with null) as possible. Because the null value handling is tricky in some cases and the query with no-nullable type is obviously faster than that of nullable type in many cases.\n\nHardware\nJoinBase is forged for modern hardware. With JoinBase in a modern box, you can sleep while handling with the global device data torrent. Therefore, don't hesitate to use the latest hardware against the JoinBase. \nToday's SSDs(Solid State Drives) are already very cheap.

With topic, JoinBase has one unique data entity object semantic description under all different protocols.\nCore\n\n\n\n Asynchronous Replication Diagram \nIn the JoinBase, the data sink is just described by the qualified table, a.k.a., database.table. The qualified table is just the topic called in MQTT protocol and the path called in HTTP protocol. \nFor example, the following PG console or shell commands are equivalent：\nProtocolsDB Entity/Topic/PathStatements/Commands\nDatabaseabc.tinsert into abc.t values (1,2)\nMQTT/abc/tmosquitto_pub -d -t /abc/t -h 127.0.0.1 -u abc -P abc -m '{\"a\":1,\"b\":2}'\nHTTP/abc/tcurl -H 'X-JoinBase-User: abc' -H 'X-JoinBase-Key: abc'  -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/abc/t' -d '{\"a\":1,\"b\":2}'\n\nTopic Aliases\nTo provide the greatest degree of semantic compatibility, JoinBase supports the concept called Topic Aliases.\nWith topic aliases, You can mapping any topic/path into the normalized topic/path in JoinBase. This is done by setting the mappings in the conf file. For example, the following lines in the conf,\n[topic.aliases]\n\"/abc/sensors\" = [\"/edge/x2view/1234567890/some_deeper_uri_path\"]\n\"/abc/sensors\" = [\"/edge/x2view/0123456789/another_deeper_uri_path\"]\n\nTwo paths \"/edge/x2view/1234567890/some_deeper_uri_path\" and \"/edge/x2view/0123456789/another_deeper_uri_path\" are mapped to one single normalized topic \"/abc/sensors\" which is equivalent to the database entity \"abc.sensors\".\n","id":"https://joinbase.io/docs/references/topics/","title":"Topics"},"https://joinbase.io/docs/references/websocket/":{"body":"","id":"https://joinbase.io/docs/references/websocket/","title":"WebSocket Interface"},"https://joinbase.io/docs/tutorials/":{"body":"","id":"https://joinbase.io/docs/tutorials/","title":"Tutorials"},"https://joinbase.io/privacy-policy/":{"body":"Introduction\nThis joinbase Cloud Preview and website Privacy Policy (this \"Policy\") applies to the functions, products and/or services provided for the users (\"You\") by joinbase's company(the company that developed the joinbase Cloud Preview and website, \"joinbase\" or \"we\").
